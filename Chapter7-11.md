Without an efficient system of protection most individuals would succumb to these hazards early in life. That system consists of multiple complementary and interdependent layers. An outer layer of specialized epithelium, including the skin and mucosal surfaces, is relatively resistant to most environmental hazards and resists infection with disease-causing microorganisms.1 If the epithelial barrier is damaged, a highly efficient local and systemic response (inflammation) is mobilized to limit the extent of damage, protect against infection, and initiate repair of the damaged tissue. The natural epithelial barrier and inflammation confer innate resistance and protection, commonly referred to as innate immunity, also known as natural or native immunity. Inflammation associated with infection usually initiates an adaptive process that results in a long-term and very effective immunity to the infecting microorganism, referred to as adaptive immunity, also known as acquired or specific immunity. Adaptive immunity is relatively slow to develop but has memory and more rapidly targets and eradicates a second infection with a particular disease-causing microorganism. The information presented in this chapter introduces the components and processes of innate immunity and sets the stage for Chapter 8, which discusses adaptive immunity. Although inflammation and adaptive immunity provide protection, either genetic or acquired aberrations in these processes can lead to disease. Diminution of innate or adaptive immunity may lead to critically decreased resistance to infection. Excessive inflammation or adaptive immunity may lead to damage to normal tissue or organs. Both may result in severe and potentially fatal disease, examples of which are discussed in Chapter 9. Many microorganisms that cause disease have developed methods of bypassing our protective systems. These are discussed in Chapter 10. Each chapter is designed to render an overview and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Protective mechanisms consist of a very large number of soluble factors and cells and would require many more pages to discuss in adequate detail. Different classes or groups of molecules and cells will be discussed, but only a few examples will be described in detail. Some components directly participate in the protective response, whereas others are designed to limit the extent of the response. Human Defense Mechanisms Innate immunity includes two lines of defense: natural barriers and inflammation (Table 7.1). Natural barriers are physical, mechanical, and biochemical barriers at the body's surfaces and are in place at birth to prevent damage by substances in the environment and thwart infection by pathogenic microorganisms. If the surface barriers are breached, the second line of defense, the inflammatory response, is activated to protect the body from further injury, prevent infection of the injured tissue, and promote healing. The inflammatory response is a rapid activation of biochemical and cellular processes that is relatively nonspecific, with similar responses being initiated against a wide variety of causes of tissue damage.

The mucosal epithelial cells are highly interconnected junctions that prohibit the passage of microorganisms into the underlying tissue. The normal turnover of the cells in these sites as well as mechanisms for “washing” the surfaces may mechanically remove many infectious microorganisms and prevent their residence on the epithelial surfaces. For instance, the routine sloughing off and replacement of dead skin cells also removes adherent bacteria. Mechanical cleansing of the surfaces includes vomiting and urination. Goblet cells of the upper respiratory tract produce mucus that coats the epithelial surface and traps microorganisms that are removed by hairlike cilia that mechanically move the mucus upward to be expelled by coughing or sneezing. Additionally, the low temperature on the skin and low pH of the skin and stomach generally inhibit microorganisms, most of which prefer temperatures near 37°C (98.6°F) and a pH near neutral for more efficient growth. FIGURE 7.1 The Closed Barrier. The digestive, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts and the skin form closed barriers between the internal organs and the environment. (From Grimes DE: Infectious diseases, St Louis, 1991, Mosby.) Biochemical Barriers Epithelial surfaces also provide biochemical barriers by synthesizing and secreting substances meant to trap or destroy microorganisms (epithelial-derived chemicals).2 Mucus, perspiration (or sweat), saliva, tears, and earwax are all examples of biochemical secretions that can trap and kill potential disease-causing microorganisms. Sebaceous glands in the skin secrete antibacterial and antifungal fatty acids and lactic acid. Perspiration, tears, and saliva contain an enzyme (lysozyme) that attacks the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. These glandular secretions result in an acidic skin surface (pH 3 to 5), which is an inhospitable environment for most bacteria. Epithelial cells secrete a complex array of proteins that destroy potential pathogens. Small-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides are generally positively charged polypeptides of approximately 15 to 95 amino acids and can be divided into two classes—cathelicidins and defensins—based on their three-dimensional chemical structures. Both classes are in very high local concentrations and are toxic to several bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Cathelicidins have a linear α-helical shape, and only one is currently known to function in humans. In contrast, about 50 different defensins have been identified thus far. All are triple-stranded β-sheet structures. Defensin molecules contain 3 intrachain disulfide bonds and can be further subdivided into α (at least 6 identified in humans) and β types (at least 10 identified, but perhaps up to 40 different molecules), depending on how the cysteine residues are connected during formation of the disulfide linkages.3 The α-defensins often require activation by proteolytic enzymes, whereas the β-defensins are synthesized in active forms. Bacteria have cholesterol-free cell membranes, which may allow cathelicidins to insert into and disrupt their membranes. Given the similarity in their chemical charges, defensins may kill bacteria in the same way. These same chemicals also may contribute to other means of protection because they are also produced by monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, which are components of the inflammatory response. Cathelicidin is stored in neutrophils, mast cells, and a variety of epithelial cells. The α-defensins are particularly rich in the granules of neutrophils and may contribute to the killing of bacteria by those cells. They are also found in Paneth cells lining the small intestine, where they protect against a variety of disease-causing microorganisms. The β-defensins are found in epithelial cells lining the respiratory, urinary, and intestinal tracts, as well as in the skin. In addition to antibacterial properties, β-defensins may also help protect epithelial surfaces from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Both classes of antimicrobial peptides also can activate cells of innate and adaptive immunity. The lung also produces and secretes a family of glycoproteins, collectins, which includes surfactant proteins A through D and mannose-binding lectin.4 Collectins react with different affinities to carbohydrates and lipids on the surfaces of a wide array of pathogenic microorganisms. Collectin binding facilitates recognition of the microorganism by macrophages, enhancing macrophage attachment, phagocytosis, and killing. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) recognizes a sugar commonly found on the surface of microbes and is a powerful activator of a plasma protein system (complement) resulting in damage to bacteria or increased recognition by macrophages. Other epithelial antimicrobials include resistin-like molecule β, bactericidal/permeability-inducing protein, and antimicrobial lectins. Resistin-like molecule β is found in the intestinal goblet cells, where it appears to protect against helminth infections. Bactericidal/permeability-inducing (BPI) protein is stored in neutrophils and intestinal epithelium. BPI protein specifically reacts with lipopolysaccharide on the surface of gram-negative bacteria, resulting in bacterial lysis. Antimicrobial lectins are carbohydrates that are found in intestinal epithelium and have activity against grampositive bacteria. Normal Microbiome The body's surfaces are colonized with a spectrum of microorganisms, the normal microbiome. Each surface, including the skin and the mucous membranes of the eyes, upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts, urethra, and vagina, is colonized by a combination of bacteria and fungi that is unique to the particular location and individual (Fig. 7.2).5 The microorganisms in the microbiome do not normally cause disease, although several are opportunistic in that they can cause disease if the integrity of the body surface is compromised or the individual's immune or inflammatory systems are defective. The relationship of the microbiome with humans has been referred to as commensal (to the benefit of one organism without affecting the other); however, the relationship may be more mutualistic (to the benefit of both organisms). Using the colon for an example, at birth the lower gut is relatively sterile but colonization with bacteria begins quickly, with the number, diversity, and concentration increasing progressively during the first year of life. To the benefit of humans, many of these microorganisms help digest fatty acids, large polysaccharides, and other dietary substances; produce biotin and vitamin K; and assist in the absorption of ions, such as calcium, iron, and magnesium. FIGURE 7.2 The Human Microbiome. Typical phylum-level composition of the human microbiota that vary at each site. (From Cho I, Blaser MJ: Nat Rev Genet 13:260–270, 2012.) These bacteria contribute to the human body's innate protection against pathogenic microorganisms in the colon. They compete with pathogens for nutrients and block attachment to the epithelium. Members of the normal microbiome also produce chemicals (ammonia, phenols, indoles, and other toxic materials) and toxic proteins (bacteriocins) that inhibit colonization by pathogenic microorganisms. Prolonged treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics can alter the normal intestinal microbiome, decreasing its protective activity, and lead to an overgrowth of opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms, such as the yeast Candida albicans or the bacteria Clostridium difficile (overgrowth can cause pseudomembranous colitis, an infection of the colon). Additionally, the normal microbiome of the gut helps train the adaptive immune system by inducing the growth of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (where cells of the adaptive immune system reside) and the development of both local and systemic adaptive immune systems.6 The bacterium Lactobacillus is a major constituent of the normal vaginal microbiome in healthy women: at least 22 different species of Lactobacillus have been identified in the vaginal microbiome, with 4 of those being predominantly represented.7 This microorganism produces a variety of chemicals (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, lactic acid, bacteriocins) that help prevent infections of the vagina and urinary tract by other bacteria and yeast. Prolonged antibiotic treatment can diminish colonization with Lactobacillus and increase the risk for urologic or vaginal infections, such as vaginosis. Opportunistic microorganisms are normally controlled by the innate and adaptive immune systems and contribute to the human body's defenses. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a member of the normal microbiome of the skin and produces a toxin that protects against infections with staphylococcal and other bacteria. However, severe burns compromise the integrity of the skin and may lead to life-threatening systemic pseudomonal infections. Second Line of Defense: Inflammation Whereas the physical and chemical barriers of the innate immune system are relatively static, inflammation is programmed to respond to cellular or tissue damage, whether the damaged tissue is septic (contaminated with microorganisms) or sterile. The inflammatory response is a rapid initiation and interactive system of humoral (soluble in the blood) and cellular systems designed to limit the extent of tissue damage, destroy contaminating infectious microorganisms, initiate the adaptive immune response, and begin the healing process (Fig. 7.3). The inflammatory response (1) occurs in tissues with a blood supply (vascularized); (2) is activated rapidly (within seconds) after damage occurs; (3) depends on the activity of both cellular and chemical components, including plasma proteins; and (4) is nonspecific, meaning that it takes place in approximately the same way regardless of the type of stimulus or whether exposure to the same stimulus has occurred in the past. FIGURE 7.3 Acute Inflammatory Response. Inflammation is usually initiated by cellular injury, which results in mast cell degranulation, the activation of three plasma systems, and the release of subcellular components from the damaged cells. These systems are interdependent, so that induction of one (e.g., mast cell degranulation) can result in activation of the other two. The result is the development of microscopic changes in the inflamed site, as well as characteristic clinical manifestations. The figure numbers refer to those in which more detailed information may be found on that portion of the response. Vascular Response Virtually any injury to vascularized tissue will activate inflammation. Injury may result from a variety of causes including infection or necrosis (e.g., trauma, oxygen deprivation [ischemia], nutrient deprivation, genetic or immune defects, chemical injury, foreign bodies, temperature extremes, ionizing radiation). The classic symptoms of acute inflammation include redness (erythema), heat, swelling (edema), and pain. This tetrad represents the “cardinal signs of inflammation” and was identified in the first century by a Roman writer, Celsus. A fifth sign was added later: loss of function. Microscopically, inflammatory changes can be seen at the vascular level (Fig. 7.4). The three characteristic changes in the microcirculation (arterioles, capillaries, and venules) near the site of an injury include the following: FIGURE 7.4 Sequence of Events in the Acute Inflammatory Response. See text for details. 1. Vasodilation (increased size of the blood vessels) causes slower blood velocity and increases blood flow to the injured site. 2. Increased vascular permeability (the blood vessels become porous from contraction of endothelial cells) and leakage of fluid out of the vessel (exudation) cause swelling (edema) at the site of injury; as plasma moves outward, blood in the microcirculation becomes more viscous and flows more slowly, and the increased blood flow and increasing concentration of red cells at the site of inflammation cause locally increased redness (erythema) and warmth. 3. White blood cells adhere to the inner walls of vessels, and they migrate through enlarged junctions between the endothelial cells lining the vessels into the surrounding tissue (diapedesis). The effects of inflammation are visible within seconds. First, arterioles near the site of infection or injury constrict briefly. Vasodilation then causes slower blood velocity and increases local blood flow to the injured site. The increased flow and capillary permeability result in leakage of plasma from the vessels, causing edema in the surrounding tissue. As plasma moves outward, blood remaining in the microcirculation flows more slowly and becomes more viscous. The increased blood flow and increasing concentration of red cells at the site of inflammation cause locally increased warmth and redness. Leukocytes adhere to vessel walls. At the same time, biochemical mediators (e.g., histamine, bradykinins, leukotrienes, prostaglandins) stimulate the endothelial cells that line capillaries and venules to retract, creating spaces at junctions between the cells, allowing leukocytes and plasma to enter the surrounding tissue (intercellular junctions are described in Chapter 1). Each of the characteristic changes associated with inflammation is the direct result of the activities and interactions of a host of chemicals and cellular components found in the blood and tissues. The vascular changes deliver leukocytes (particularly neutrophils), plasma proteins, and other biochemical mediators to the site of injury where they act in concert. Benefits of inflammation include: 1. Prevention of infection and further damage by contaminating microorganisms through the influx of fluid to dilute toxins produced by bacteria and released from dying cells, the influx and activation of plasma protein systems that help destroy and contain bacteria (e.g., complement system, clotting system), and the influx of cells (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages) that “eat” and destroy cellular debris and infectious agents. 2. Limitation and control of the inflammatory process through the influx of plasma protein systems (e.g., clotting system), plasma enzymes, and cells (e.g., eosinophils) that prevent the inflammatory response from spreading to areas of healthy tissue. 3. Interaction with components of the adaptive immune system to elicit a more specific response to contaminating pathogen(s) through the influx of macrophages and lymphocytes. 4. Preparation of the area of injury for healing through removal of bacterial products, dead cells, and other products of inflammation (e.g., by way of channels through the epithelium or drainage by lymphatic vessels) and initiation of mechanisms of healing and repair. Extravascular fluid and debris that accumulate at an inflamed site are drained by lymphatic vessels. This process also facilitates the development of adaptive immunity because microbial antigens in lymphatic fluid pass through the lymph nodes, where they activate both B and T lymphocytes. (This process is discussed in Chapter 8, and the lymphatic system is described in Chapter 28.) The lymphatic vessels may, themselves, become secondarily inflamed. Lymphangitis of the lymph vessels and lymphadenitis of the nodes, which become hyperplastic, enlarge and frequently become painful. Inflammation and repair can be divided into several phases (Fig. 7.5). The characteristics of the early (i.e., acute) inflammatory response differ from those of the later (i.e., chronic) response, and each phase involves different biochemical mediators and cells that function together. The acute inflammatory response is of short duration; that is, it continues only until the immediate threat to the host is eliminated. This usually takes 8 to 10 days from onset to healing. (Mechanisms of cellular injury are described in Chapter 2.) FIGURE 7.5 Inflammatory Phases. Cellular injury leads to acute inflammation and may result in resolution and healing of the injured site or may progress into chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation in turn may result in healing or progress to development of a granuloma. The final step of the inflammatory process is usually healing and reconstruction of the damaged tissue. The figure numbers refer to those in which more detailed information on that portion of the process may be found. Plasma Protein Systems Three key plasma protein systems are essential to an effective inflammatory response. These are the complement system, the clotting system, and the kinin system (Figs. 7.6, 7.7, and 7.8, respectively). Although each system has a unique role in inflammation, they also have many similarities. Each system consists of multiple proteins in the blood. To prevent activation in unnecessary situations, each protein is normally in an inactive form. Several of the proteins are enzymes that circulate in inactive forms as proenzymes. Each system contains a few proteins that can be activated early in inflammation. Activation of the first component of a system results in sequential activation of other components, leading to a biologic function that helps protect the individual. This sequential activation is referred to as a cascade. Thus, we refer to the complement cascade, the clotting cascade, or the kinin cascade. In some cases, activation of a protein may require that it be enzymatically cut into two pieces or fragments of different size. Usually the larger fragment continues the cascade by activating the next component, and the smaller fragment frequently has potent biologic activities to promote inflammation. FIGURE 7.6 Pathways of Complement Cascade Activation. The complement system is activated by three pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. During activation, many complement components are cleaved into fragments (2b, 4a, Ba, C3a, and C5a). The smaller fragments frequently have potent biologic activities and may serve as chemotactic factors and anaphylatoxins. The larger activated fragments are usually converted into active enzymes (indicated by the bar above the names) and form complexes with additional components in the cascade. The classical pathway is usually activated by antigen-antibody complexes through component C1, which consists of C1q and two C1r and C1s molecules. As indicated, the C1q must simultaneously bind to two antibody molecules (indicated by Y-shaped structures). The lectin pathway is activated by mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which binds to two mannose-rich pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the surface of a bacterium. MBL contains two associated enzymes, MASP-1 and MASP-2, and functions in a manner similar to C1. C1 and MBL each activate complement components C4 and C2. The alternative pathway is activated by many agents, such as bacterial polysaccharides, which bind and stabilize C3b, which is produced by normal breakdown of C3 in the blood. The C3b forms the site of binding of factor B (fB), which is activated by factor D (fD) into Bb and the small fragment Ba. Properdin (P) helps stabilize the complex. Each pathway produces C3 and C5 convertases, which are enzymatically active complexes that activate C3 and C5, respectively. C3b produced by the C3 convertase can function as an opsonin. C5b initiates assemblage of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which results in multiple C9 molecules forming a pore in the bacterial membrane. FIGURE 7.7 Coagulation Cascade. Clotting is activated through two pathways: the intrinsic (contact) pathway and the extrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is initiated by the activation of Hageman factor (XII) into XIIa (activated factors are enzymes and are indicated by a lowercase a). The sequential activation of other intrinsic pathway components results in formation of a complex of IXa, VIIIa, and X. The extrinsic pathway is activated by exposure of tissue factor (TF) during tissue damage. TF complexes with factor VII, which is activated (VIIa) and forms a complex with factor X (TF, VIIa, X). Both the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathway complexes are dependent on calcium, form on phospholipid membranes that are rich in phosphatidylserine, and have “tenase” activity (can activate factor X into Xa). Factor X begins a common pathway in which Xa complexes with Va and prothrombin (PT), with calcium and phospholipid membranes, to form an active prothrombinase (activates prothrombin into thrombin). Thrombin is an enzyme that cuts high-molecular-weight fibrinogen into fibrin molecules. Fibrin polymerizes to form a clot. FIGURE 7.8 Plasma Kinin Cascade. The kinin pathway is activated by factor XIIa from the clotting system, which functions as an enzyme (prekallikrein activator) to convert prekallikrein into kallikrein. Enzymatically active kallikrein converts kininogen into bradykinin. Complement System The complement system consists of several plasma proteins (sometimes called complement components) that together constitute about 10% of the total circulating serum protein. Activation of the complement system produces several factors that can destroy pathogens directly and can activate or collaborate with other components of the innate and adaptive immune responses. Factors produced during activation of the complement system are among the body's most potent defenders, particularly against bacterial infection.8 Activation of the complement system can be accomplished in three different pathways, all of which converge at the third component (C3) of the pathway: 1. Classical pathway: activated by proteins of the adaptive immune system (antibodies) bound to their specific targets (antigen) 2. Lectin pathway: activated by mannose-containing bacterial carbohydrates 3. Alternative pathway: activated by gram-negative bacterial and fungal cell wall polysaccharides The principal routes by which the complement cascade may be activated are shown in Fig. 7.6. Activation of the classical pathway begins with the activation of complement protein C1 and is preceded by formation of a complex between an antigen and an antibody to form an antigen-antibody complex (immune complex) (discussed in Chapter 8). The antigen may be a unique chemical component of the surface of a bacterium or other microorganism. Most pathogens express multiple antigens; therefore, multiple antibodies are usually bound in the complex. The first component of the classical complement cascade, C1, has six sites that can bind to antibodies, and efficient activation of the complement cascade usually requires concurrent binding of C1 to at least two antibody molecules. The complex formed by antigen-antibodycomplement binding is shown in Fig. 7.6. C1 is a macromolecular complex consisting of C1q and two molecules each of C1r and C1s. A conformational change in C1 results in an enzymatically active molecule whose substrates are C4 and C2. The resultant complex formed by the interaction of C1, C4, and C2 uses C3 as a substrate, resulting in the production of C3a and C3b. A complex that has C3 as a substrate is generally referred to as a C3 convertase. The addition of C3b to the complex changes the substrate specificity to C5, resulting in the conversion of C5 to C5a and C5b. A complex that has C5 as a substrate is generally called a C5 convertase. Thus activation of C1 initiates the sequential enzymatic activation of all other components of the classical pathway, ultimately resulting in the activation of C5. The classical pathway also can be activated to a lesser degree by biologic molecules other than antibody, including heparin (a charged molecule that prevents clotting), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), and C-reactive protein, which is increased in the blood during inflammation. Even under normal conditions small amounts of circulating C3 are spontaneously broken down into C3b and C3a by a number of naturally occurring enzymes in the blood. The rate of C3 spontaneous activation is generally very low, and C3b is readily inactivated by complement regulator proteins in the blood (e.g., factor H and factor I). However, materials produced by some infectious microorganisms (e.g., lipopolysaccharides [endotoxins] on the bacterial surface, yeast cell wall carbohydrates [zymosans]) can bind the naturally produced C3b and protect it from inactivation. This will initiate activation of the alternative complement pathway. The C3b bound to bacterial products can react with another normally occurring component, factor B. The complex of C3b and factor B is recognized by an enzyme, factor D, which activates factor B, producing factor Bb. The resultant C3b/Bb complex is very unstable unless it binds to properdin (P). The C3b/Bb/P complex is a C3 convertase that produces further C3b, resulting in a C3b/Bb/P/C3b complex that is a C5 convertase, which activates C5. The lectin pathway is similar to the classical pathway but is antibody independent. It is activated by a plasma protein called mannose-binding lectin (MBL). MBL is similar to C1q and binds to bacterial polysaccharides containing the carbohydrate mannose and activates complement through two MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP-1 and MASP-2) that substitute for C1r and C1s and activate C4 and C2 to create a C3 convertase.9 Thus, infectious agents that do not activate the alternative pathway may be susceptible to complement through the lectin pathway. After activation of C5, the cascade continues through the terminal components C6, C7, C8, and C9. Components C5b through C9 assemble to form complexes (membrane attack complex, or MAC) capable of creating pores in cell membranes and permitting the influx of water and ions and may ultimately result in cell lysis. The most important result of complement activation is the production of fragments during the activation of C4, C2, C3, and C5. The fragments C4a, C2b, C3a, and C5a are soluble and of low- molecular-weight that contribute in other ways to the inflammatory response. C2b affects smooth muscle, causing vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. C3a and C5a, and to a limited extent C4a, are anaphylatoxins; that is, they induce rapid mast cell degranulation (release of granular contents) and the release of histamine (see Fig. 7.12), causing vasodilation and increased capillary permeability.10 C5a is the major chemotactic factor for neutrophils. C3a is approximately 100 times less potent in chemotactic and anaphylatoxic activity. A chemotactic factor is a biochemical substance that attracts leukocytes to the site of inflammation. The dual functions of a chemotactic factor and an anaphylatoxin are not needed simultaneously or to the same degree. Anaphylatoxic activity is necessary early in inflammation and occurs close to the inflammatory site to induce local mast cell degranulation and to increase the number of soluble mediators available to enhance vascular permeability and vasodilation. Chemotactic activity, on the other hand, is required for a much longer period and occurs distal to the inflammatory site to attract leukocytes from the circulation. Thus it is beneficial to an effective inflammatory response to limit the range of anaphylatoxic activity while allowing widespread chemotactic activity. A plasma enzyme, a carboxypeptidase, removes a terminal arginine on both C3a and C5a peptides, thereby producing “C3a desArg” and “C5a desArg,” respectively, which are inactive as anaphylatoxins but retain chemotactic activity. Thus chemotactic activity is retained, while not inducing distal mast cell degranulation that would result in considerable enlargement of the inflammatory response to the detriment of surrounding healthy tissue. C3b adheres to the surface of a pathogenic microorganism and serves as an efficient opsonin. Opsonins are molecules that “tag” microorganisms for destruction by cells of the inflammatory system (primarily neutrophils and macrophages). C3b on the cell surface also can be broken down by several enzymes in the blood into inactive fragments (e.g., iC3b), which retain opsonic activity. In summary, the complement cascade can be activated by at least three different means, and its products have four functions: (1) anaphylatoxic activity resulting in mast cell degranulation (C3a, C3b), (2) leukocyte chemotaxis (C5a), (3) opsonization (C3b), and (4) cell lysis (C5b-C9, MAC). Clotting System The clotting (coagulation) system is a group of plasma proteins that, when activated sequentially, forms a blood clot at an injured or inflamed site. A blood clot is a meshwork of protein (fibrin) strands that contains platelets (the primary cellular initiator of clotting) and traps other cells, such as erythrocytes, phagocytes, and microorganisms. This (1) prevents the spread of infection to adjacent tissues, (2) traps microorganisms and foreign bodies at the site of inflammation for removal by infiltrating cells (e.g., neutrophils and macrophages), (3) forms a clot that stops bleeding, and (4) provides a framework for future repair and healing. The main substance in this fibrinous mesh is an insoluble protein called fibrin that is the end product of the coagulation cascade. The clotting system can be activated by many substances that are released during tissue injury and infection, including collagen, proteinases, kallikrein, and plasmin, as well as by bacterial products such as endotoxins. Like the complement cascade, the coagulation cascade can be activated through different convergent pathways (see Fig. 7.7). The tissue factor (extrinsic) pathway is activated by tissue factor (TF) (also called tissue thromboplastin) that is released by damaged endothelial cells in blood vessels and reacts with activated factor VII (VIIa).11 The intrinsic (contact) pathway is activated when the vessel wall is damaged and Hageman factor (factor XII) in plasma contacts negatively charged subendothelial substances. The pathways converge at factor X. Activation of factor X begins a common pathway leading to activation of fibrin that polymerizes to form a fibrin clot. The coagulation system is discussed in more detail and illustrated again in Chapter 28. As with the complement system, activation of the clotting system produces protein fragments that enhance the inflammatory response. Two low-molecular-weight fibrinopeptides, A and B, are released from fibrinogen when fibrin is produced. Both fibrinopeptides (especially fibrinopeptide B) are chemotactic for neutrophils and increase vascular permeability of endothelial cells by enhancing the effects of bradykinin (formed from the kinin system). Kinin System The third plasma protein system, the kinin system, augments inflammation in several ways. The primary product from the kinin system is bradykinin, which causes dilation of blood vessels, acts with prostaglandins to stimulate nerve endings and induce pain, causes smooth muscle cell contraction, increases vascular permeability, and may increase leukocyte chemotaxis (see Fig. 7.3). Bradykinin induces smooth muscle contraction more slowly than histamine and, along with prostaglandins of the E series, is probably responsible for endothelial cell retraction and increased vascular permeability in the later phases of inflammation (endothelial cell retraction is shown in Figs. 7.4 and 7.16). The kinin system is activated by stimulation of the plasma kinin cascade (see Fig. 7.8). The conversion of plasma prekallikrein to kallikrein is induced by prekallikrein activator, which is identical to factor XIIa (the product that results from activation of Hageman factor —factor XII) of the clotting cascade. Kallikrein then converts kininogen to bradykinin. Although the plasma kinin cascade is one pathway that leads to the production of bradykinin, tissue kallikreins in saliva, sweat, tears, urine, and feces provide other sources for this inflammatory mediator. These tissue kallikreins convert serum kininogens to kallidin, also known as Lys-bradykinin, which may be converted to bradykinin by plasma aminopeptidase. In order to limit the extent of inflammation, kinins are rapidly degraded by kininase enzymes present in plasma and tissues. Control and Interactions of Plasma Protein Systems The three plasma protein systems are highly interactive so that activation of one system results in the production of a large number of very potent, biologically active substances that further activate the other systems (Fig. 7.9). Very tight control of these processes is essential for two reasons: FIGURE 7.9 Interactions between the Complement, Clotting, and Kinin Systems. Thick colored arrows denote the activation of factors within a system. Thin colored arrows denote the interaction between systems. 1. The inflammatory process is critical for an individual's survival; thus, efficient activation must be guaranteed regardless of the cause of tissue injury. 2. The biochemical mediators generated during these processes are so potent and potentially detrimental to the individual, and their actions must be strictly confined to injured or infected tissues. Multiple mechanisms are available to either activate or inactivate (regulate) these plasma protein systems. For instance, the plasma that enters the tissues during inflammation (edema) contains enzymes that destroy mediators of inflammation. Carboxypeptidase inactivates the anaphylatoxic activities of C3a and C5a, and kininases degrade kinins. Histaminase degrades histamine and kallikrein and down-regulates the inflammatory response. The formation of clots also activates a fibrinolytic system that is designed to limit the size of the clot and remove the clot after bleeding has ceased. Thrombin activates plasminogen in the blood to form the enzyme plasmin. The primary activity of plasmin is to degrade fibrin polymers in clots. However, plasmin also can activate the complement cascade through components C1, C3, and C5 and the kinin cascade by activating factor XII and producing prekallikrein activator. Activation of Hageman factor has four effects that impact all three of the plasma protein systems: 1. Activation of the clotting cascade through factor XI 2. Control of clotting through conversion of plasminogen proactivator to plasminogen activator, resulting in the generation of plasmin 3. Activation of the kinin system by activated Hageman factor (prekallikrein activator) 4. Activation of C1 in the complement cascade The activity of plasmin itself is also regulated because it is synthesized as a proenzyme, plasminogen. Plasminogen is converted to plasmin by several factors, including plasminogen activator generated from the kallikrein system, thrombin generated from the clotting system, bacterial factors such as streptokinase produced by hemolytic streptococci, plasminogen activators produced by endothelial cells, and several cellular enzymes released during tissue destruction. Another example of a common regulator is C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-inh).12 C1-inh inhibits complement activation through reactivity with C1 (classical pathway), MASP-2 (lectin pathway), and C3b (alternative pathway). It is also a major inhibitor of clotting and kinin pathway components (e.g., kallikrein, XIIa). A genetic defect in C1-inh (C1-inh deficiency) results in hereditary angioedema, which is a self- limiting edema of cutaneous and mucosal layers resulting from stress, illness, or relative minor or unapparent trauma. The disease is characterized by hyperactivation of all three plasma protein systems, although excessive production of bradykinin appears to be the principal cause of increased vascular permeability. Cellular Mediators of Inflammation Inflammation is a process in vascular tissue; thus, the cellular components are found in the blood and in the tissue surrounding the blood vessels. The vessels are lined with endothelial cells, which under normal conditions actively maintain normal blood flow. During inflammation the vascular endothelium becomes a principal coordinator of blood clotting and the passage of cells and fluid into the tissue. The tissue close to the vessels contains mast cells, which are probably the most important activators of inflammation, and dendritic cells, which connect the innate and adaptive immune responses. The blood contains a complex mixture of cells (see Fig. 7.4). Blood cells are divided into erythrocytes (red blood cells), platelets, and leukocytes (white blood cells). Erythrocytes carry oxygen to the tissues, and platelets are small cell fragments involved in blood clotting. Leukocytes are subdivided into granulocytes (containing many enzyme-filled cytoplasmic granules), monocytes, and lymphocytes. Granulocytes are the most common leukocytes and are classified by the type of stains needed to visualize their granules (basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils). Monocytes in the blood are precursors of macrophages that are found in the tissues. Various forms of lymphocytes participate in the innate (e.g., natural killer [NK] cells) and the adaptive immune response (B and T cells). Cells of both innate and acquired immune systems are recruited and activated by biochemical mediators produced at the site of cellular damage. These molecules originate from destroyed or damaged cells, contaminating microbes, activation of the plasma protein systems, or secretions by other cells of the innate or acquired immune systems. Activation may result in the cell gaining a function critical to the inflammatory response or induction of the release of additional cellular products that increase inflammation, or both. These inflammatory cells and protein systems, along with the substances they produce, act at the site of tissue injury to confine the extent of damage, kill microorganisms, and remove the debris of “battle” in preparation for healing: tissue regeneration or repair (processes known as resolution). Cellular Receptors Cells of both innate and adaptive immunity must recognize and respond to their environment, whether to products of damaged cells or to potential pathogenic microorganisms. Each cell has receptors on the cell surface that specifically bind soluble substances (ligands) produced during tissue damage or infection. The binding of a ligand to its receptor results in activation of intracellular signaling pathways and activation of the cell. As will be discussed in Chapter 8, B and T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system have evolved surface receptors (i.e., the T-cell receptor, or TCR, and the B-cell receptor, or BCR) that bind a large spectrum of antigens. Cells involved in innate resistance have evolved a different set of receptors that recognize a much more limited array of specific molecules. These are referred to as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and they recognize molecular “patterns” on infectious agents or their products (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs), or products of cellular damage (necrosis or apoptosis; damage-associated molecular patterns, or DAMPs).13 PRRs are generally found on cells at the interface of the host and environment (i.e., skin, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract), where they monitor for products of cellular damage and potentially infectious microorganisms. Although most PRRs are on the cell surface, some are secreted or intracellular.14 An example of a secreted PRR is mannose-binding lectin of the lectin pathway of complement activation. Cellular PRRs include Toll-like receptors, complement receptors (CRs), scavenger receptors, glucan receptors, and mannose receptors. In humans, at least 11 different Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been described, 10 of which are functional.15 They are expressed on the surface of many cells that have direct and early contact with potential pathogenic microorganisms. These include mucosal epithelial cells, mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and some subpopulations of lymphocytes. (Dendritic cells are found in the skin, mucosa, and lymphoid tissues, where they have developed from Langerhans cells and function as highly specialized initiators of the adaptive immune response.) TLRs recognize a large variety of PAMPs located on the microorganism's cell wall or surface (e.g., bacterial lipopolysaccharide [LPS], peptidoglycans, lipoproteins, yeast zymosan, viral coat proteins), other surface structures (e.g., bacterial flagellin), or microbial nucleic acid (e.g., bacterial DNA, viral double-stranded RNA). Some TLRs recognize host factors that are produced by “stressed” or damaged cells (e.g., breakdown products of extracellular matrix proteins, chromatin). Interactions between PAMPs and TLRs, with the collaboration of other cellular receptors (e.g., CD14), can result in activation of the cell and the release of soluble products (e.g., cytokines) that increase local resistance to the pathogenic microorganism. TLRs are also one of the bridges between innate resistance and the adaptive immune response through the induction of cytokines that increase the response of lymphocytes to foreign antigens on the pathogens. Genetic polymorphisms in TLRs may explain some observed differences among individuals' resistance and susceptibility to infections. Information on each of the TLRs found in humans is shown in Table 7.2. TABLE 7.2 CELLULAR SOURCE AND MICROBIAL TARGET FOR EACH TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR (TLR) RECEPTOR CELLULAR EXPRESSION PATTERN PAMP RECOGNITION TLR1 Cell surface (ubiquitous): neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, NK cells Fungal, bacterial, viral; forms heterodimer with TLR2 (TLR2 recognition) TLR2 Cell surface: neutrophils, Fungal (yeast zymosan), bacterial (gram- monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells positive bacterial peptidoglycan, lipoproteins), viral (lipoproteins) TLR3 Intracellular: monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, NK cells, epithelial cells Double-stranded RNA produced by many viruses TLR4 Cell surface: granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, epithelial cells Bacterial (primarily gram-negative bacterial LPS, lipoteichoic acids), viral (RSV F protein, hepatitis C) TLR5 Cell surface: granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, epithelial cells Bacterial (flagellin); forms heterodimer with TLR4 TLR6 Cell surface: monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, NK cells Fungal, bacterial, viral; forms heterodimer with TLR2 (TLR2 recognition) TLR7 Intracellular: monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells Natural ligand uncertain; may bind viral single-strand RNA TLR8 Cell surface: monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells Natural ligand uncertain; may bind fungal PAMPs or viral single-stranded RNA TLR9 Intracellular: monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells Bacterial (unmethylated DNA [CpG dinucleotides]) TLR10 Cell surface: monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells Natural ligand uncertain; may form heterodimers with TLR2 TLR11 TLR11 gene does not code a full-length protein in humans No known immune response DNA, Deoxyribonucleic acid; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NK, natural killer; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; RNA, ribonucleic acid; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus. Complement receptors are found on many cells of the innate and adaptive immune responses (e.g., granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages, lymphocytes, mast cells, erythrocytes, platelets), as well as some epithelial cells. They recognize several fragments produced through activation of the complement system.16 Under a variety of normal and disease-related conditions, immune complexes of antibody, antigen, and complement form in the blood and are removed by cells expressing surface complement receptor-1 (CR1), which binds to C4b, C3b, and C3b breakdown products (e.g., iC3b). CR2 is found on B lymphocytes, as well as dendritic cells and some epithelial cells, and recognizes C3b breakdown products (particularly iC3b). CR2 appears to facilitate B-cell function and antibody production. Both CR3 and CR4 are integrins that primarily recognize C3b breakdown products (particularly iC3b). CR3 (integrin αMβ2, also called CD11b/CD18) facilitates phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. CR4 (αXββ2, also called CD11c/CD18) is found primarily on platelets. (Integrins are cell surface receptors that have a role in cell adhesion and attachment and mediate intracellular signaling within the extracellular matrix [see Fig. 1.17].) Scavenger receptors are primarily expressed on macrophages and facilitate recognition and phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens, as well as damaged cells and altered soluble lipoproteins associated with vascular damage (e.g., high-density lipoprotein [HDL], acetylated low-density lipoprotein [LDL], oxidized LDL).17 More than eight receptors have been identified. Some scavenger receptors (e.g., SRPSOX) recognize the cell membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS). PS is normally sequestered on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane, but it is externalized under a very limited variety of conditions, including erythrocyte senescence and cellular apoptosis. Thus, macrophages, through this receptor, can identify and remove old red blood cells and cells undergoing apoptosis. Another important scavenger receptor is CD14, which recognizes the complex of LPS and LPS-binding protein. LPS-binding protein is up-regulated during inflammation by the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1 and helps remove bacterial LPS (endotoxin) from the circulation. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are cytoplasmic receptors that recognize products of microbes and damaged cells.18 At least 22 NLRs have been identified in humans. NOD-1 and NOD-2 are cytoplasmic and recognize fragments of peptidoglycans from intracellular bacteria and initiate production of proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6. Some NLRs associate with intracellular multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes. Inflammasomes primarily bind cellular stress–related molecules, a type of DAMP, and through the activation of caspases-1 control the activation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β.19 Cellular Products To elicit an effective inflammatory (or adaptive immune) response, intercellular communication and cooperation are necessary. Cytokines constitute a large family of small-molecular-weight soluble intercellular-signaling molecules that are secreted, bind to specific cell membrane receptors, and regulate innate or adaptive immunity (Fig. 7.10). Cytokines may be either proinflammatory or antiinflammatory in nature, depending on whether they tend to induce or inhibit the inflammatory response. These molecules usually diffuse over short distances, but some effects occur over long distances, such as the systemic induction of fever by some cytokines (i.e., endogenous pyrogens) that are produced at an inflammatory site. Binding of cytokines to a target cell often induces synthesis of additional cellular products. For example, binding of the cytokine TNF-α to a cell may result in synthesis and release of IL-1. FIGURE 7.10 Principal Mediators of Inflammation. C3b, Large fragment produced from complement component C3; C5a, small fragment produced from complement component C5; ECF-A, eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis; ENA, epithelial-dermoid neutrophil attractant; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; G-CSF, granulocyte colony–stimulating factor; IFN, interferon; IgG, immunoglobulin G (predominant class of antibody in the blood); IL, interleukin; MCF, monocyte chemotactic factor; M-CSF, monocyte colony–stimulating factor; NCF, neutrophil chemotactic factor; PAF, platelet-activating factor; TGF, T-cell growth factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. The actions of chemokines and cytokines are pleiotropic, indicating that the same molecule may have a large variety of different biologic activities depending on the particular target cell to which it binds. In addition, the same molecule may be produced by a large spectrum of cells, many of which are not part of inflammation or the immune system. These molecules may be synergistic, so that their combined activity exceeds the sum of their individual activities, or have antagonistic properties that cause them to inhibit each other. (A partial list cytokines that are particularly relevant to the acquired immune response is provided in Chapter 8, Table 8.4.) A large number of cytokines have been described and are classified into several families. The terms lymphokines and monokines refer respectively to cytokines secreted from lymphocytes or monocytes, although cytokines are secreted by many different types of cells. Chemokines are members of a special family of cytokines that are chemotactic and primarily attract leukocytes to sites of inflammation. Chemokines are synthesized by many cell types, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, in response to proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α. To date, more than 50 different human chemokines have been described. Examples include those that primarily attract macrophages (e.g., monocyte/macrophage chemotactic proteins [MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3], macrophage inflammatory proteins [MIP-1α and MIP-1β]) or neutrophils (e.g., IL8). Cytokines. The majority of important cytokines are classified as interleukins or interferons. Other critical cytokines, however, are not classified as either. Many of these same cytokines are produced by cells of the acquired immune system in response to specific antigens and are discussed further in Chapter 8. The interleukins (ILs) are biochemical messengers produced predominantly by macrophages and lymphocytes in response to stimulation of PRRs or by other cytokines. More than 30 interleukins have been identified. Their effects include the following: 1. Alteration of adhesion molecule expression on many types of cells 2. Attraction of leukocytes to a site of inflammation (chemotaxis) 3. Induction of proliferation and maturation of leukocytes in the bone marrow 4. General enhancement or suppression of inflammation 5. Mediation of development of the acquired immune response Two major proinflammatory interleukins are IL-1 and IL-6, which cooperate closely with another cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is produced in two forms (IL-1α and IL1β) mainly by macrophages. IL-1 activates monocytes, other macrophages, and lymphocytes, thereby enhancing both innate and acquired immunity, and acts as a growth factor for many cells.20 It has several effects on neutrophils, including induction of proliferation (resulting in an increase in the number of circulating neutrophils), attraction to an inflammatory site (chemotaxis), and an increase in cellular respiration and lysosomal enzyme activity (both effects resulting in increased cellular killing of bacteria). IL-1 is an endogenous pyrogen (i.e., fever-causing cytokine) that reacts with receptors on cells of the hypothalamus and affects the body's thermostat, resulting in fever. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is produced by macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and other cells. IL-6 directly induces hepatocytes (liver cells) to produce many of the proteins needed in inflammation (acutephase reactants, discussed later in this chapter).21 IL-6 also stimulates growth and differentiation of blood cells in the bone marrow and the growth of fibroblasts (required for wound healing). Although not classified as an interleukin, tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-α) is secreted by macrophages and other cells (e.g., mast cells) in response to recognition of PAMPs by TLRs.22 Macrophages secrete TNF-α in response to recognition of PAMPs by TLRs. TNF-α is initially synthesized as a membrane-anchored protein, which is cleaved into a soluble form by a membrane-associated protease, TNFconverting enzyme (TACE). Soluble TNF-α induces a multitude of proinflammatory effects, including enhancement of endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression and induction of chemokine production by both endothelial cells and macrophages. When secreted in large amounts, TNF-α has systemic effects as well: 1. Induces fever by acting as an endogenous pyrogen 2. Causes increased synthesis of proinflammatory serum proteins by the liver 3. Causes muscle wasting (cachexia) and intravascular thrombosis as a consequence of prolonged production in cases of severe infection or cancer 4. Probably responsible for fatalities from shock caused by gramnegative bacterial infections Some cytokines are antiinflammatory and diminish the inflammatory response. The most important are IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is primarily produced by lymphocytes and suppresses the growth of other lymphocytes and the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages, leading to the downregulation of both inflammation and the adaptive immune response. Transforming growth factors, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), are produced by many types of cells in response to inflammation and induce cell division and differentiation of other cell types, such as immature blood cells. Interferons (IFNs) are members of a family of low-molecularweight proteins that primarily protect against viral infections and modulate the inflammatory response. (Mechanisms of viral infection are described in Chapter 10.) Type I interferons (primarily IFN-α, IFNβ) are produced and released by virally infected cells in response to viral double-stranded RNA and other viral PAMPs.23 Type I IFNs do not kill viruses directly but instead are secreted from virally infected cells, attach to a receptor on neighboring cells, and, if the neighboring cells are uninfected, stimulate the production of a variety of antiviral proteins that will interfere with transcription of viral nucleic acids or with viral replication. Interferons are species specific, meaning that human interferon is effective only in humans; however, these cytokines are not virus specific, meaning that they are effective against almost all viruses. Type II interferon (IFN-γ) is produced primarily by lymphocytes; it activates macrophages, resulting in increased capacity to kill infectious agents (including viruses and bacteria), and it enhances the development of acquired immune responses against viruses. Chemokines. Chemokines are members of a family of low-molecular-weight (8 to 10 kDa) peptides that function primarily to induce leukocyte chemotaxis.24 This response can be elicited either by soluble chemokines or by chemokines that are bound to extracellular glycosaminoglycan carbohydrates. Chemokines can be synthesized by multiple cell types, including macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, in response to proinflammatory cytokines. Macrophages can be stimulated to produce chemokines by recognition of either infectious microorganisms or a β-defensin (both through TLR4). To date, more than 40 different human chemokines have been described, the vast majority of which are classified as either CC-chemokines (β-chemokines) or CXC-chemokines (α-chemokines), depending on the arrangement of cysteine amino acids in the protein. This amino acid arrangement also determines which target cell(s) will respond to a given chemokine. CC-chemokines affect mainly monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, whereas CXC-chemokines generally affect neutrophils. Examples of CC-chemokines include RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), monocyte/macrophage chemotactic proteins (MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3), and macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-1α and MIP1β). CXC-chemokines include IL-8 and epithelial-dermoid neutrophil attractant (ENA-78). Mast Cells and Basophils The mast cell is probably the most important cellular activator of the inflammatory response. Mast cells, first described by Paul Ehrlich25 in 1877, are cellular bags of granules located in the loose connective tissues close to blood vessels near the body's outer surfaces (i.e., in the skin and lining the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts) (Fig. 7.11). Basophils are found in the blood and probably function in the same way as tissue mast cells. A great number of stimuli activate mast cells to release potent soluble inducers of inflammation. These are released by (1) degranulation (the release of the contents of mast cell granules) and (2) synthesis (the new production and release of mediators in response to a stimulus). Typical causes of mast cell activation include (1) physical injury (e.g., heat, mechanical trauma, ultraviolet light, and x-rays), (2) chemical agents (e.g., toxins, snake and bee venoms, proteolytic enzymes, and antimicrobial peptides), (3) immunologic means (e.g., anaphylatoxins released during activation of complement components or particular types of antibody [e.g., immunoglobulin E (IgE)] produced by cells of the adaptive immune response [see Chapter 8]), and (4) activation of TLRs by bacteria and viruses. Soluble and extremely potent chemicals from the mast cell are responsible for its effects on inflammation. Mast cells are also involved in initiating many allergic responses (discussed in Chapter 9). FIGURE 7.11 Effects of Degranulation (left) and Synthesis (right) by Mast Cells. The depiction of a tissue mast cell shows darkly stained granules in the cytoplasm. IGE, Immunoglobulin E; IL-4, interleukin-4; IL-13, interleukin-13; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. Degranulation. In response to a stimulus, biochemical mediators in the mast cell granules, including histamine, chemotactic factors (e.g., neutrophil chemotactic factor, eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis or ECF-A), and cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-4), are released within seconds and exert their effects immediately (see Fig. 7.11). Histamine is a small-molecular-weight molecule with potent effects on many other cells, particularly those that control the circulation. Histamine, along with serotonin (found in many cells, but not human mast cells), is called a vasoactive amine. Histamine causes temporary, rapid constriction of smooth muscle and dilation of the postcapillary venules, both of which result in increased blood flow into the microcirculation. Histamine also causes increased vascular permeability resulting from retraction of endothelial cells lining the capillaries and increased adherence of leukocytes to the endothelium (see Fig. 7.4). The pharmacologic effects of histamine are partially determined by histamine receptors on the person's target cells. Two main histamine receptors are the H1 and H2 receptors (Fig. 7.12), and two other receptors, H3 and H4, have been described.26 Binding of histamine to the H1 receptor is essentially proinflammatory; that is, it promotes inflammation. On the other hand, binding to the H2 receptor is generally antiinflammatory because it results in suppression of leukocyte function. The H1 receptor is present on smooth muscle cells, especially those of the bronchi, and causes bronchial smooth muscle to contract (bronchoconstriction) when stimulated. Both types of receptors are distributed among many different cells and are often present on the same cells and may act in an antagonistic fashion. For instance, neutrophils express both types of receptors, with stimulation of H1 receptors resulting in the augmentation of neutrophil chemotaxis, and H2 stimulation resulting in its inhibition. The H2 receptor is especially abundant on parietal cells of the stomach mucosa and induces the secretion of gastric acid as part of the normal physiology of the stomach. The role of H1 and H2 receptors is discussed further in Chapter 9. FIGURE 7.12 Effects of Histamine through H1 and H2 Receptors. Effects depend on (1) density and affinity of H1 or H2 receptors on the target cell, and (2) the identity of the target cell. ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate. Mast cell granules also contain chemotactic factors, two of which are neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) and eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A). Chemotaxis is directional movement of cells along a chemical gradient formed by a chemotactic factor (see Fig. 7.4). Neutrophils (attracted by NCF) are the predominant leukocytes at work during the early phases of acute inflammation, and eosinophils (attracted by ECF-A) have several functions in the inflammatory process; both of these important inflammatory cells are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Synthesis of Mediators. Activated mast cells initiate synthesis of other mediators of inflammation, including those derived from plasma membrane lipids (leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet-activating factor),27 cytokines (TNF-α, various interleukins), and factors that stimulate cell growth and angiogenesis. Leukotrienes (also known as slow-reacting substances of anaphylaxis [SRS-A]) are products of arachidonic acid, which is released from mast cell membranes by an intracellular phospholipase that acts on membrane phospholipids (Fig. 7.13). Leukotrienes are acidic, sulfur-containing lipids produced by lipoxygenase that produce effects similar to those of histamine: smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability, and perhaps neutrophil and eosinophil chemotaxis. Leukotrienes appear to be important in the later stages of the inflammatory response because they stimulate slower and more prolonged responses than do histamines. FIGURE 7.13 Production of Lipid Vasoactive Substances by Mast Cells. LTA4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, LTB4, Various leukotriene molecules; PAF, platelet-activating factor; PGD2, prostaglandin D2. Prostaglandins are long-chain unsaturated fatty acids produced from arachidonic acid by the action of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) and are classified into groups (E, D, A, F, and B) according to their structure. Prostaglandins E1 and E2 cause increased vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction, apparently acting directly on postcapillary venules. They can inhibit some aspects of inflammation by suppressing both the release of histamine from mast cells and the release of lysosomal enzymes (enzymes responsible for killing and digesting microorganisms) from neutrophils. Enhancement or suppression of the inflammatory response may be related to the concentration of prostaglandins. Cyclooxygenase exists in two different forms: COX-1 is found in most tissues and COX-2 is associated with inflammation. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, blocking synthesis of prostaglandins of the E series, but inhibition of COX-1 causes complications, such as gastrointestinal toxicity. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are now available. Dietary free fatty acids also promote antiinflammatory effects (see Nutrition & Disease: Essential Fatty Acids and Inflammation). Nutrition & Disease Essential Fatty Acids and Inflammation Both omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential fatty acids available only in the diet. They are essential because human physiologic processes cannot add the necessary double bonds to the carbon chains. Omega-6 fatty acids are contained in vegetable oils, and most are linolenic acid. Omega-3 essential fatty acids, which are mostly alpha-linolenic acid, are found in green leafy vegetables, walnuts, flaxseed, and canola oil. The metabolic products of alpha-linolenic acid are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and the richest source of these acids is in the oils of deep-sea cold-water fish. Both the omega-3 and the omega-6 fatty acids use the same enzymes to produce their metabolic products, and they compete for this enzyme, delta-5-desaturase. Delta-5-desaturase converts EPA into antiinflammatory prostaglandins (PGs) of the PGE3 series. The omega-6 fatty acid dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) can be converted to either antiinflammatory PG1 or arachidonic acid (AA), a precursor of inflammatory PG2 and leukotrienes. Conversion of DGLA into PG1 does not require any enzymes, but conversion of DGLA into AA requires the enzymes delta-6- and delta-5desaturase. When the diet is high in omega-3 fatty acids, most of the delta-5-desaturase will be used in the omega-3 pathway and the production of antiinflammatory prostaglandins. Little delta-5desaturase will be available to convert DGLA into arachidonic acid and subsequent inflammatory mediators. DGLA ends up being converted into the antiinflammatory PG1, and, overall, inflammation is decreased. The resulting antiinflammatory effects of omega-3 essential fatty acids decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other conditions associated with inflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease blood triglyceride concentrations; decrease production of chemoattractants, growth factors, and adhesion molecules; lower blood pressure; increase nitric oxide production, endothelial relaxation, and vascular compliance; decrease thrombosis and cardiac dysrhythmias; and stabilize or reverse atherosclerotic plaque. The American diet tends to be high in saturated and omega-6 fatty acids and deficient in omega-3 fatty acids, with a ratio estimated at about 15 : 1. The Mediterranean-style diet has more whole grains, fish, olive oil, fresh fruits, and vegetables, and a more balanced ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids estimated at about (3–4):1. Increasing omega-3 fatty acids in the diet may significantly improve health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other diseases associated with chronic inflammation. From Backes J et al: Lipids Health Dis 15(1):118, 2016; Sears B: J Am Coll Nutr 34(Suppl 1):14– 21, 2015. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is produced by removal of a fatty acid from the plasma membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase A2. Although mast cells are a major source of PAF, this molecule also can be produced during inflammation by neutrophils, monocytes, endothelial cells, and platelets. The biologic activity of PAF is virtually identical to that of leukotrienes: causing endothelial cell retraction to increase vascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, and platelet activation. Endothelium The blood vessel walls consist of a layer of endothelial cells that adhere to an underlying matrix of connective tissue that contains a variety of proteins, including collagen, fibronectin, and laminins. Circulating cells and platelets and components of plasma protein systems continually contact endothelial cells, which contribute to regulation of normal blood flow by preventing spontaneous activation of platelets and members of the clotting system.28 Nitric oxide (NO) produced from arginine and prostacyclin (PGI2) from arachidonic acid maintain blood flow and pressure and inhibit platelet activation. PGI2 and NO are synergistic. NO is released continually to relax vascular smooth muscle and suppress the effects of low levels of cytokines, thus maintaining vascular tone. PGI2 production varies a great deal and is increased when additional regulation is needed. Damage to the endothelial cell lining of the vessel exposes the subendothelial connective tissue matrix, which is prothrombogenic and initiates platelet activation and formation of clots (the contact activation [intrinsic] clotting pathway). Proinflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, prostacyclin, and many others) affect the endothelium, resulting in adherence of leukocytes to the vessel surface, invasion of leukocytes into the tissue, and efflux of plasma from the vessel. Platelets Platelets (thrombocytes) are anucleate cytoplasmic fragments formed from megakaryocytes. They circulate in the bloodstream until vascular injury occurs, resulting in platelet activation. Platelets can be activated by many products of both the innate and the adaptive immune responses, including collagen, thrombin, thromboxane, PAF, and antigen-antibody complexes.29 Activated platelets (1) relocate plasma membrane phosphatidylserine to the cell surface, which provides a foundation for interaction with components of the coagulation cascade to stop bleeding; (2) degranulate to release biochemical meditators such as serotonin (a vasoactive amine with histamine-like vasoactive effects); and (3) synthesize thromboxane A2 (TXA2) from prostaglandin H2. Platelets contain alpha (α) granules and dense granules. Alpha granules generally contain polypeptides that affect inflammation, including coagulation proteins (e.g., fibrinogen, factor V), soluble adhesion molecules (e.g., von Willebrand factor, vitronectin), growth factors that promote wound healing (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor), protease inhibitors (e.g., plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, α2-antiplasmin), and membrane adhesion molecules (e.g., P-selectin, αIIbβ3).30 Dense granules contain several small molecules, including adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin, calcium, and magnesium. TXA2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and inducer of platelet aggregation. Prolonged use of low-dose aspirin preferentially suppresses production of TXA2 without interfering with the production of antiinflammatory PGI2 by endothelium. (Platelet function is described in detail in Chapter 28.) Phagocytes The primary role of most granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) and monocytes/macrophages is phagocytosis, the process by which a cell ingests and disposes of damaged cells and foreign material, including microorganisms. Neutrophil. The neutrophil, or polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN), is a member of the granulocytic series of white blood cells and is named for the characteristic staining pattern of its granules, as well as its multilobed nucleus. Neutrophils are the predominant phagocytes in the early inflammatory site, arriving within 6 to 12 hours after the initial injury, where they ingest (phagocytose) bacteria, dead cells, and cellular debris. Several inflammatory mediators (e.g., some bacterial proteins, complement fragments C3a and C5a, and mast cell neutrophil chemotactic factor) specifically attract neutrophils from the circulation and activate them. Macrophages and lymphocytes, on the other hand, enter the site later, usually after 24 hours, and gradually replace the neutrophils. Because the neutrophil is a mature cell incapable of division and sensitive to the acidic environment it is short-lived at the inflammatory site and becomes a component of the purulent exudate, or pus, which is removed from the body through the epithelium or through the lymphatic system. (The lymphatic system is described in Chapter 28.) The primary roles of the neutrophil are removal of debris in sterile lesions, such as burns, and phagocytosis of bacteria in nonsterile lesions. Eosinophil. Another population of granulocytes is the eosinophil. Although eosinophils are only mildly phagocytic, they have two specific functions: (1) to serve as the body's primary defense against parasites and (2) to help regulate vascular mediators released from mast cells. Their role in resistance to parasites occurs in collaboration with specific antibodies produced by the adaptive immune system and will be discussed in Chapter 8. Regulation of mast cell–derived inflammatory mediators is critical for control of inflammation. The acute inflammatory response is needed only in a circumscribed area and for a limited time. Therefore, control mechanisms are necessary to prevent biochemical mediators from evoking more inflammation than necessary. Mast cells' ECF-A attracts eosinophils to the site of inflammation. Eosinophil lysosomal granules contain enzymes that degrade vasoactive molecules, thereby controlling the vascular effects of inflammation.31 Histaminase degrades histamine, and arylsulfatase B degrades leukotrienes. Basophil. The basophil is the least prevalent granulocyte in the blood. It is very similar to mast cells in the content of its granules and, in addition, is an important source of the cytokine IL-4, which is a key regulator of the adaptive immune response.32 Although often associated with allergies and asthma, its primary role is yet unknown. Dendritic Cells. Dendritic cells provide one of the major links between the innate and acquired immune responses. They are the primary phagocytic cells located in the peripheral organs and skin, where molecules released from infectious agents are encountered, recognized through PRRs, and internalized through phagocytosis. Dendritic cells then migrate through the lymphatic vessels to lymphoid tissue, such as lymph nodes, and interact with T lymphocytes to generate an acquired immune response.33 Through the production of a family of cytokines, they guide development of a subset of T cells (helper cells) that coordinate the development of functional B and T cells (discussed in Chapter 8). Monocyte and Macrophage. Monocytes are the largest normal blood cells (14 to 20 µm in diameter) and have a nucleus that is often indented, or horseshoe shaped. Monocytes are produced in the bone marrow, enter the circulation, and migrate to the inflammatory site where they develop into macrophages. Monocytes also appear to be the precursors of macrophages that are found in tissues (tissue macrophages, discussed in Chapter 8), including Kupffer cells in the liver, alveolar macrophages in the lungs, and microglia in the brain. Macrophages are generally larger (20 to 40 µm) and are more active as phagocytes than their monocytic precursors. Macrophages, particularly those residing in the tissues, are often important cellular initiators of the inflammatory response (Fig. 7.14). FIGURE 7.14 Scanning Electron Micrograph of Lymphocytes and Macrophages. The lymphocytes are small and spherical; the macrophages are larger and more irregular in shape. (From Raven PH, Johnson GB: Biology, St Louis, 1992, Mosby.) Monocyte-derived macrophages from the circulation may appear at the inflammatory site as soon as 24 hours after the initial neutrophil infiltration, but usually arrive 3 to 7 days later. Neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages are cooperative but differ chiefly in the following ways: 1. Speed: Neutrophils arrive at the injury site first, whereas macrophages move more sluggishly. 2. Active life span: Macrophages survive and divide in the acidic inflammatory site, whereas neutrophils cannot. 3. Chemotactic factors: Neutrophils and macrophages are not attracted by the same factors, such as macrophage chemotactic factor, which is released by neutrophils. 4. Content of their lysosomes, or digestive vacuoles: Neutrophils produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species, myeloperoxidase, and antimicrobial proteins compared to macrophages. 5. Role in the immune response: Macrophages, but not neutrophils, are involved in activation of the adaptive immune system. 6. Role in wound repair: Macrophages are the primary cells that infiltrate tissue in wounds, remove cells and cellular debris, promote angiogenesis, and produce cytokines and growth factors that suppress further inflammation and initiate healing by promoting epithelial cell division, activating fibroblasts, and promoting synthesis of extracellular matrix and collagen. Phagocytosis. The two most important phagocytes are neutrophils and macrophages. Both cells are circulating in the blood and must first leave the circulation and migrate to the site of inflammation before initiating phagocytosis (Fig. 7.15). Under normal conditions, the circulation in the capillaries and venules is rapidly moving with red blood cells in the main stream and neutrophils and other leukocytes tending to flow more slowly along the vessel's periphery. Many of the biochemical products produced early at inflammatory sites (e.g., histamine, TNF-α, bradykinin, leukotrienes, prostaglandins) diffuse to the vessels and affect both leukocytes and endothelial cells. FIGURE 7.15 Process of Phagocytosis. The process that results in phagocytosis is characterized by three interrelated steps: adherence and diapedesis, tissue invasion by chemotaxis, and phagocytosis. A, Tissue damage. Adherence, margination, and diapedesis: The primary phagocyte in the blood is the neutrophil, which usually moves freely within the vessel (1). At sites of inflammation, the neutrophil progressively develops increased adherence to the endothelium, leading to accumulation along the vessel wall (margination or pavementing) (2). At sites of endothelial cell retraction, the neutrophil exits the blood by means of diapedesis (3). Chemotaxis: In the tissues, the neutrophil detects chemotactic factor gradients through surface receptors (1) and migrates toward higher concentrations of the factors (2). The high concentration of chemotactic factors at the site of inflammation immobilizes the neutrophil (3). B, Recognition and attachment. Specific receptors and ligands for recognition and attachment. C, Phagocytosis. (1) Opsonized microorganisms are recognized and bind to the surface of a phagocyte through specific receptors. (2) The microorganism is engulfed (ingested) into a phagocytic vacuole, or phagosome. (3) Lysosomes fuse with the phagosome, resulting in the formation of a phagolysosome. During this process the microorganism is exposed to products of the lysosomes, including a variety of enzymes and products of the hexose-monophosphate shunt (e.g., H2O2, ). (4) The microorganism is killed and digested. Ab, Antibody; AbR, antibody receptor; Ag, antigen; C3b, complement component C3b; C3bR, complement C3b receptor; PAMP, pathogenassociated molecular pattern; PRR, pattern recognition receptor. Both cell populations respond by expressing new cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on their surfaces. CAMs are a family of transmembrane proteins that provide adhesion between cells or between a cell and components of extracellular matrix (e.g., fibronectin, collagen, fibrinogen). The most important CAMs related to vascular inflammation are selectins and integrins. Selectins are CAMs that bind carbohydrate ligands on transmembrane glycoproteins: E-selectins are found on endothelial cells, L-selectins on leukocytes, and P-selectins on platelets and endothelial cells. Integrins are proteins consisting of alpha (α) and beta (β) chains that primarily provide cell-to-cell adhesion by binding to ligands on another cell. Their affinity for a ligand is dependent on conformational changes of the integrin molecule. The reciprocal change in adhesion molecules on leukocytes (from low-affinity integrins to high-affinity integrins), as well as platelets, promotes their interaction with the endothelial cells.34 The initial change of surface molecules increases the adhesion, or stickiness, between leukocytes and endothelial cells, causing the leukocytes to adhere more avidly to the walls of the capillaries and postcapillary venules in a process called margination, or pavementing (see Fig. 7.15). Adhesion molecules, such as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecules (PCAMs), that are expressed later lead to diapedesis or emigration of the cells through the endothelial junctions that have retracted in response to the same mediators.35 The leukocytes digest the basement membrane and migrate into the surrounding tissues. Additionally, endothelial cells release NO, a gas that under normal conditions maintains vascular tone. Inflammation induces additional endothelial nitric oxide synthase, increasing the amount of NO production. Effects of NO on inflammation include vasodilation by inducing relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, a response that is local and short-lived, and suppression of mast cell function as well as platelet adhesion and aggregation. Once inside the connective tissue in the perivascular space, leukocytes migrate to the inflammatory site by means of chemotaxis. They detect chemotactic factors in the environment through chemoreceptors at multiple locations on their plasma membranes and migrate in the direction of highest concentration (see Fig. 7.15). The primary chemotactic factors include many bacterial products, complement fragments C3a and C5a, kallikrein, plasminogen activator, products of fibrin degradation (fibrinopeptides), and chemokines, such as IL-8. Eosinophils and neutrophils also respond to chemotactic factors released from mast cells (ECF-A, neutrophil chemotactic factor [NCF]). Monocytes are attracted toward a factor (monocyte chemotactic factor) that has been released by neutrophils already at the site of injury. And although histamine is not itself chemotactic, it may facilitate the chemotactic effects of other factors. Once the phagocytic cell enters the inflammatory site, the process of phagocytosis involves four steps: (1) opsonization (recognition of the target and adherence of the phagocyte to it); (2) engulfment (ingestion or endocytosis) and formation of phagosome; (3) fusion of the phagosome with lysosomal granules within the phagocyte to form a phagolysosome; and (4) destruction of the target (see Fig. 7.15, C) (lysosomes are described in Chapter 1). Throughout the process, both the ingested material and the digestive enzymes are isolated within membranebound vesicles. Isolation protects the phagocyte itself from the harmful effects of a microorganism, as well as its own enzymes. Most phagocytes can trap and engulf bacteria using cellular PRRs and PAMPs normally expressed on the bacterial surface (see Fig. 7.15, B). However, that process is slow and inefficient. Opsonization, usually by antibody or complement component C3b, greatly enhances both recognition and adherence. Phagocytosis of a red blood cell is illustrated in Fig. 7.16. Opsonins function as “glue” between the phagocyte and the target cell because receptors on the phagocyte are specific for sites on the opsonin (Fc receptors for antibody, C3b receptors for C3b). This enables the phagocyte to bind an opsonized target very tightly to its surface. Antibody forms a stronger attachment, but the signal through the C3b receptor activates the phagocytic process to a greater extent. FIGURE 7.16 Steps in Phagocytosis. This scanning electron micrograph shows the progressive steps in phagocytosis. A, Red blood cells (R) attach to the surface of a macrophage (M). B, Part of the macrophage (M) membrane starts to enclose the red cell (R). C, The red blood cells are almost totally engulfed by the macrophage. (From King DW, Fenoglio CM, Lefwitch JH: General pathology: principles and dynamics, Philadelphia, 1983, Lea & Febiger.) Although the inflammatory response is considered to be nonspecific, opsonins and other recognition molecules add a degree of specificity to efficient phagocytosis. Antibodies on the surface of bacteria are directed against antigens that are highly specific to that particular microorganism. Certain bacterial and fungal polysaccharide coatings activate the alternative and lectin pathways of complement activation resulting in C3b deposition. Engulfment (endocytosis) is carried out by small pseudopods that extend from the plasma membrane and surround the adherent microorganism, forming an intracellular phagocytic vacuole, or phagosome (see Figs. 7.15 and 7.16). The membrane that surrounds the phagosome consists of inverted plasma membrane. Lysosomes converge on and fuse with the phagosome, creating a phagolysosome. The primary lysosomal granules (azurophilic granules) contain a variety of bactericidal molecules, including myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, defensins, acid hydrolases, elastase, and others. Most phagocytes also contain secondary granules (specific granules) with molecules that are bactericidal and involved in remodeling the surrounding tissue, including lysozyme, collagenase, lactoferrin, and other proteases. Destruction of the bacterium takes place within the phagolysosome and is accomplished by both oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms. Oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms result from the production of toxic oxygen species. Phagocytosis is accompanied by a burst of oxygen uptake by the phagocyte, termed the “respiratory burst,” which results from a shift in much of the cell's glucose metabolism to the hexose-monophosphate shunt. The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) that is produced because of this shift is used by a membrane-associated enzyme, NADPH oxidase, to generate superoxide, a reactive oxygen intermediate that is converted to hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species. Many of the reactive oxygen species are directly toxic to the microorganism. Hydrogen peroxide also can collaborate with the lysosomal enzyme myeloperoxidase and halide anions (Cl− and Br−) to form acids, such as hypochlorous (HClO) and hypobromous (HBrO) acids. These acids probably kill bacteria and fungi by adding Cl− or Br− to the surface of these cells. Oxygen-independent mechanisms of microbial killing include (1) the acidic pH (3.5 to 4.0) of the phagolysosome caused by lactic acid production; (2) cationic proteins, such as defensins and cathelicidins, that bind to and damage cell membranes; (3) enzymatic attack of the microorganism's cell wall by lysozyme and other enzymes; and (4) inhibition of bacterial growth by lactoferrin that binds iron. When a phagocyte dies at an inflammatory site, it frequently lyses (breaks open) and releases its cytoplasmic contents into the tissue. Although released lysosomal products may contribute to inflammation by increasing vascular permeability, attracting additional monocytes, and activating the complement and kinin systems, they also may increase the tissue destruction associated with inflammation. For instance, the contents of neutrophil primary granules (e.g., lysozyme, hydrolases, neutral proteases) and secondary granules (e.g., lysozyme, collagenase, gelatinase) can digest the connective tissue matrix. The destructive effects of many enzymes and reactive oxygen molecules released by dying phagocytes are minimized by natural inhibitors found in the blood, such as superoxide dismutase (breaks down superoxide), catalase (breaks down hydrogen peroxide), and the antiproteinases α1-antitrypsin and α2-macroglobulin (both produced by the liver). An inherited deficiency of α1-antitrypsin often results in chronic lung damage and emphysema as a result of inflammation. (The pulmonary effects of α1antitrypsin deficiency are described in Chapter 36.) Macrophage Activation. Several bacteria are resistant to killing by granulocytes and can even survive inside macrophages. Microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis), Mycobacterium leprae (leprosy), Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever), Brucella abortus (brucellosis), and Listeria monocytogenes (listeriosis) can remain dormant or even multiply inside the phagolysosomes of macrophages. The bactericidal activity of macrophages can be markedly increased by activation. Macrophage activation results in two subpopulations of cells. M1 macrophages are activated through TLRs by substances found in sites of inflammation (e.g., microbial products, endotoxin, or interferon-γ [IFN-γ]) and produce NO and cytokines, release lysosomal granules, and have greater bacterial killing capacity. M2 macrophages are activated by cytokines produced by subsets of T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) and are primarily involved in healing and repair. Activated macrophages have increased (1) phagocytic activity, (2) size, (3) ruffling of the plasma membrane to increase surface area, (4) glucose metabolism, and (5) number of lysosomes.36 Activated macrophages also secrete factors that stimulate the growth, differentiation, and activation of other inflammatory cells as well as control the initiation of healing processes. These include granulocyte colony–stimulating factor (GCSF), IFN-γ, IL-1β, angiogenic factor, fibroblast activating factor, and growth factors that promote regeneration of damaged tissues. Macrophages are also the primary cells that infiltrate wounds to remove cellular debris and initiate the regenerative process. In some cases, inadequate macrophage activation results from defects in the adaptive immune responses and deficits in the production of appropriate cytokines. For example, a form of leprosy called lepromatous leprosy is characterized by the survival of phagocytosed M. leprae bacteria in macrophage phagolysosomes. In individuals with lepromatous leprosy, cells of the adaptive immune system have failed to secrete the cytokines necessary to transform macrophages into highly efficient killing cells. Natural Killer Cells and Lymphocytes The main function of natural killer (NK) cells is recognition and elimination of cells infected with viruses, although they are also somewhat effective at elimination of other abnormal cells, specifically cancer cells. NK cells seem to be more efficient in this role when they encounter abnormal cells within the circulatory system as opposed to within tissues. Along with TLRs, NK cells have additional inhibitory and activating receptors that allow differentiation between infected or tumor cells and normal cells. If the NK cell binds to a target cell through activating receptors, it produces several cytokines and toxic molecules that can kill the target. NK cells and lymphocytes, which are the principal cells of the adaptive immune response, will be discussed in much more detail in Chapter 8. Local Manifestations of Inflammation The cells and plasma protein systems described previously interact to produce all the characteristics of inflammation, whether local or systemic, as well as determine the duration of inflammation, either acute or chronic. Local inflammation accompanies all types of cellular and tissue injury, whether infected or sterile, from fractures or strains of the musculoskeletal system to burn injuries (see Chapters 2 and 49), and is responsible for initiating healing. All the local manifestations of acute inflammation (i.e., swelling, pain, heat, and redness) result from vascular changes and the subsequent leakage of circulating components into the tissue. Heat and redness are the result of vasodilation and increased blood flow through the injured site. Swelling occurs as exudate (fluid and cells) accumulates. Swelling is usually accompanied by pain caused by pressure exerted by exudate accumulation, as well as the presence of soluble biochemical mediators such as prostaglandins and bradykinin.37 Loss of function at the cellular, tissue, or organ level is associated with these manifestations. Exudate varies in composition, depending on the stage of the inflammatory response and, to some extent, the injurious stimulus. In early or mild inflammation, the exudate is watery (serous) with very few plasma proteins or leukocytes. An example of serous exudate is the fluid in a blister. In more severe or advanced inflammation, the exudate may be thick and clotted (fibrinous exudate), such as in the lungs of individuals with pneumonia. If a large number of leukocytes accumulate, as in persistent bacterial infections, the exudate consists of pus and is called a purulent (suppurative) exudate. Purulent exudate is characteristic of walled-off lesions (cysts or abscesses). If bleeding occurs, the exudate is filled with erythrocytes and is described as a hemorrhagic exudate. Although the local manifestations of inflammation can affect all vascularized tissues, lesions vary depending on the organ or tissue involved. The lesion resulting from widespread cellular death (necrosis), for example, differs in myocardial (heart muscle), brain, and hepatic (liver) tissues. Cellular death resulting from myocardial infarction (deprivation of oxygen caused by cessation of blood flow) causes a response that proceeds to replacement of the dead tissue with a fibrinous scar. The same injury to brain tissue is more likely to result in the formation of an abscess filled with necrotic tissue (types of necrosis are described in Chapter 2). Destruction of liver tissue stimulates the regrowth, or regeneration, of liver cells. Systemic Manifestations of Acute Inflammation The three primary systemic changes associated with the acute inflammatory response are fever, leukocytosis (a transient increase in the levels of circulating leukocytes), and plasma protein synthesis (increased levels of circulating plasma proteins). Fever Fever is an early systemic response, which is partially induced by specific cytokines, for example, IL-1 released from neutrophils and macrophages. These fever-causing cytokines are known as endogenous pyrogens to differentiate them from pathogen-produced exogenous pyrogens. Pyrogens act directly on the hypothalamus, the portion of the brain that controls the body's thermostat. The release of endogenous pyrogens by inflammatory cells occurs after phagocytosis, after exposure to bacterial endotoxins, or after exposure to antigen-antibody complexes. (Mechanisms of temperature regulation are discussed in Chapter 16.) A febrile response can be beneficial because the microorganisms that cause some conditions (e.g., those that cause syphilis or gonococcal urethritis) are highly sensitive to small increases in body temperature. On the other hand, fever may have some harmful side effects because it may enhance the person's susceptibility to the effects of endotoxins associated with gram-negative bacterial infections (bacterial toxins are described in Chapter 10). Leukocytosis Leukocytosis is an increase in the number of circulating white blood cells (greater than 11,000/mL3 in adults). During many infections, leukocytosis may be accompanied by a left shift in the ratio of immature to mature neutrophils, so that the more immature forms of neutrophils, such as band cells, metamyelocytes, and occasionally myelocytes, are present in relatively greater than normal proportions. (Chapter 28 discusses the development and maturation of blood cells.) Production of immature leukocytes increases primarily from proliferation and release of granulocyte and monocyte precursors in the bone marrow, which is stimulated by several products of inflammation, including complement product C3a and G-CSF. Plasma Protein Synthesis The synthesis of many plasma proteins, mostly products of the liver, is increased during inflammation. These proteins, which can be either proinflammatory or antiinflammatory in nature, are referred to as acute-phase reactants (Table 7.3). Acute-phase reactants reach maximal circulating levels within 10 to 40 hours of initial infection. IL1 is indirectly responsible for the synthesis of acute-phase reactants through the induction of IL-6, which directly stimulates liver cells to synthesize most of the acute-phase reactants. TABLE 7.3 CIRCULATING LEVELS OF ACUTE-PHASE REACTANTS DURING INFLAMMATION CIRCULATING LEVELS OF ACUTE-PHASE REACTANTS DURING INFLAMMATION FUNCTION INCREASED DECREASED Coagulation components Fibrinogen Prothrombin Factor VIII Plasminogen None Protease inhibitors α1-Antitrypsin Inter-α-antitrypsin α1-Antichymotrypsin Transport proteins Complement components Miscellaneous proteins Haptoglobin Hemopexin Ceruloplasmin Ferritin C1s, C2, C3, C4, C5, C9, factor B, C1 inhibitor α1-Acid glycoprotein Fibronectin Serum amyloid A (SAA) C-reactive protein (CRP) Transferrin Properdin Albumin Prealbumin α1-Lipoprotein β-Lipoprotein Common laboratory tests for inflammation measure levels of acutephase reactants. For example, an increase in blood levels of acutephase reactants, primarily fibrinogen, is associated with an increased adhesion among erythrocytes and a corresponding increase in the sedimentation rate. The alteration in plasma proteins probably leads to an enhanced erythrocyte rouleaux formation (stacking of erythrocytes, as in a stack of coins) and thereby an increased rate of sedimentation. Although increased erythrocyte sedimentation is a nonspecific reaction, it is considered a good indicator of an acute inflammatory response. Other symptoms of acute inflammation include somnolence (drowsiness), malaise (generalized feeling of discomfort or illness), anorexia (lack of desire to eat), and muscle aching. Chronic Inflammation Superficially, the difference between acute and chronic inflammation is purely one of duration, in that chronic inflammation lasts 2 weeks or longer regardless of cause. Characteristic histologic and mechanistic differences also may be present (Fig. 7.17). Chronic inflammation is sometimes preceded by an unsuccessful acute inflammatory response. For example, if bacterial contamination or foreign objects (e.g., dirt, wood splinters, glass) persist in a traumatic wound, an acute response may be prolonged beyond 2 weeks. Pus formation, suppuration (purulent discharge), and incomplete wound healing may characterize this type of chronic inflammation. FIGURE 7.17 The Chronic Inflammatory Response. Inflammation usually becomes chronic because of the persistence of an infection, an antibody, or a foreign body in the wound. Chronic inflammation is characterized by the persistence of many of the processes of acute inflammation. In addition, the presence of large amounts of neutrophil degranulation and death, the activation of lymphocytes, and the concurrent activation of fibroblasts result in the release of mediators that induce the infiltration of more lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages and the beginning of wound healing and tissue repair. Chronic inflammation can occur also as a distinct process without much previous acute inflammation. Some microorganisms (e.g., mycobacteria that cause tuberculosis) have cell walls with a very high lipid and wax content, making them relatively insensitive to degradation by phagocytes and therefore relatively resistant to clearance in an acute inflammatory response. Other microorganisms, such as those that cause leprosy, syphilis, and brucellosis, can survive within the macrophage and thereby also avoid clearance by the acute inflammatory response. Other microorganisms produce toxins that damage tissue and cause persistent inflammation even after the microorganism is killed. Finally, chemicals, particulate matter, or physical irritants (e.g., inhaled dusts, wood splinters, and suture material) also can cause a prolonged inflammatory response. Chronic inflammation is characterized by a dense infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages. If macrophages are unable to limit the tissue damage or infection, the body attempts to wall off and isolate the infected area, thus forming a granuloma (Fig. 7.18). Granulomas may form if neutrophils and macrophages are unable to destroy microorganisms during the acute inflammatory response. For example, infections caused by some bacteria (Listeria sp., Brucella sp.), fungi (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis), and parasites (leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, toxoplasmosis) can result in granuloma formation. Large antigen-antibody complexes such as those present in rheumatoid arthritis also can result in the formation of these structures. TNF-α primarily drives granuloma formation. Some macrophages differentiate into large epithelioid cells, cells that are incapable of phagocytosing large bacteria but are capable of taking up debris and other small particles. Other macrophages fuse into multinucleated giant cells, which are active phagocytes that can engulf very large particles—larger than those that can be engulfed by a single macrophage. These two types of specialized cells form the center of the granuloma, which is surrounded by a wall of lymphocytes. The granuloma itself is also often encapsulated by fibrous deposits of collagen and may become cartilaginous or possibly calcified by deposits of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. FIGURE 7.18 Tuberculous Granuloma. A central area of amorphous caseous necrosis (C) is surrounded by a zone of lymphocytes (L) and enlarged epithelioid cells (E). Activated macrophages frequently fuse to form multinucleated cells (Langhans giant cells). In tuberculoid granulomas the nuclei of the giant cells move to the cellular margins in a horseshoe-like formation. The classic granuloma associated with tuberculosis is characterized by a wall of epithelioid cells surrounding a cheeselike proteinaceous center derived from dead and decaying tissue (caseous necrosis, see Chapter 2) and mycobacteria. Decay of cells within the granuloma results in the release of acids and the enzymatic contents of lysosomes from dead phagocytes. In this inhospitable environment, the cellular debris is broken down and a clear fluid may remain (liquefaction necrosis, see Chapter 2). Eventually this fluid diffuses out and leaves a hollow, thick-walled structure that has replaced normal tissue and reduces organ function. Wound Healing The conclusion of inflammation is healing and repair. The most favorable outcome of healing is tissue regeneration (replacement of damaged tissue with healthy tissue, such as occurs in the epithelia of the skin and intestines, and in some organs, such as liver) with complete return to normal structure and function (Fig. 7.19). This restoration is called resolution, may take up to 2 years, and local production of IL-10 appears to play a critical role. Resolution may not be possible if extensive damage is present, the tissue is not capable of regeneration, infection results in abscess or granuloma formation, or fibrin persists in the lesion. In those cases, repair takes place instead of resolution. Repair is the replacement of destroyed tissue with scar tissue. Scar tissue is composed primarily of collagen that fills in the lesion and restores strength but cannot carry out the physiologic functions of destroyed tissue, resulting in loss of function. FIGURE 7.19 Wound Repair by Primary or Secondary Intention. A–D, Healing by primary intention. E–I, Healing by secondary intention. Wound healing involves processes that (1) fill in, (2) seal, and (3) shrink the wound. These characteristics of healing vary in importance and duration among different types of wounds. A clean incision, such as a paper cut or a sutured surgical wound, heals primarily through the process of collagen synthesis. Because this type of wound has minimal tissue loss and close apposition of the wound edges, very little sealing (epithelialization) and shrinkage (contraction) are required. Wounds that heal under conditions of minimal tissue loss are said to heal by primary intention (see Fig. 7.19). Other wounds do not heal as easily. Healing of an open wound, such as a stage IV pressure injury (bedsore), requires a great deal of tissue replacement so that epithelialization, scar formation, and contraction take longer and healing occurs through secondary intention (see Fig. 7.19). Healing by either primary or secondary intention may occur at different rates for different types of tissue injury. Epidermal wounds that heal by secondary intention and unsutured internal lesions are not completely restored by healing. At best, repaired tissue regains 80% of its original tensile strength. Only epithelial, hepatic (liver), and bone marrow cells are capable of the complete mitotic regeneration of the normal tissue known as compensatory hyperplasia. In fibrous connective tissue, such as joints and ligaments, normal healing results in replacement of the original tissue with new tissue that does not have exactly the same structure or function as that of the original. Some tissues heal without replacement of cells. For example, damage resulting from myocardial infarction heals with a scar composed of fibrous tissue rather than with cardiac muscle. Wound healing occurs in three overlapping phases: inflammation, proliferation and new tissue formation, and remodeling and maturation.37a Phase I: Inflammation The early phase of wound healing, the transition from acute inflammation to healing, begins almost immediately. The inflammatory phase includes coagulation and the infiltration of cells that participate in wound healing, including platelets, neutrophils, and macrophages.38 The fibrin mesh of the blood clot acts as a scaffold for cells that participate in healing. Platelets contribute to clot formation and, as they degranulate, release growth factors that initiate proliferation of undamaged cells. Neutrophils and macrophages clear the wound of debris (fibrin from dissolved clots, microorganisms, erythrocytes, and dead tissue cells). This cleanup of the lesion, which also involves dissolution of fibrin clots (or scabs) by fibrinolytic enzymes, is called débridement. After débridement the remaining debris is drained away by blood vessels and lymphatics, and the vascular dilation and permeability associated with inflammation are reversed, thus preparing the lesion for either regeneration or repair. Phase II: Proliferation and New Tissue Formation (Reconstruction) The proliferative phase begins 3 to 4 days after the injury and continues for as long as 2 weeks. The wound is sealed and the fibrin clot is replaced by normal tissue or scar tissue during this phase. The proliferative phase is characterized by macrophage invasion of the dissolving clot and recruitment and proliferation of fibroblasts (connective tissue cells), followed by fibroblast collagen synthesis, epithelialization, contraction of the wound, and cellular differentiation.39 Macrophages secrete a variety of biochemical mediators that promote healing, including the following: 1. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) stimulates fibroblasts entering the lesion to synthesize and secrete the collagen precursor procollagen. 2. Angiogenesis factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), stimulate vascular endothelial cells to form capillary buds that grow into the lesion; decreased pH and decreased wound oxygen tension also promote angiogenesis. 3. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade and remodel extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., collagen and fibrin) at the site of injury.40 Granulation tissue grows into the wound from surrounding healthy connective tissue and consists of invasive cells, new lymphatic vessels, and new capillaries derived from capillaries in the surrounding tissue, giving the granulation tissue a red, granular appearance. Capillary buds sprout from vascular endothelial cells around the wound and extend into the débrided areas. Loops form when the young capillaries join (anastomose). The loops are more fragile and permeable than mature vessels, resulting in leakage of erythrocytes and neutrophils. The erythrocytes are phagocytosed by macrophages, and the neutrophils assist in further débridement of the inflammatory lesion. Many of the new capillaries differentiate into larger vessels as repair continues, promoting influx of nutrients and removal of metabolic wastes. New lymphatic vessels also grow into the granulation tissue by a similar process. The healing wound must be protected during this process. Epithelialization is the process by which epithelial cells grow into the wound from surrounding healthy tissue. Epithelial cells migrate under the clot or scab using MMPs to unravel collagen. Migrating epithelial cells contact similar cells from all sides of the wound and seal it. The epithelial cells remain active, undergoing differentiation to give rise to the various epidermal layers. Epithelialization of a skin wound can be hastened if the wound is kept moist, preventing the fibrin clot from becoming a scab. Fibroblasts are important cells during healing because they secrete collagen and other connective tissue proteins. Fibroblasts are stimulated by macrophage-derived TGF-β to proliferate, enter the lesion, and deposit connective tissue proteins in débrided areas about 6 days after the fibroblasts have entered the lesion. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body. It contains high concentrations of the amino acids glycine, proline, and lysine, many of which are enzymatically modified. Modification of proline and lysine requires several cofactors that are absolutely necessary for proper collagen polymerization and function. These include iron, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and molecular oxygen (O2); absence of any of these results in impaired wound healing. Immature collagen (i.e., procollagen) is secreted by fibroblasts as a complex of three polypeptide chains cross-linked by intermolecular bonds. Procollagen is converted to mature collagen by the proteolytic removal of small polypeptide sequences at both ends of the trimer. As healing progresses, collagen molecules are cross-linked by intramolecular covalent bonds to form collagen fibrils that are further cross-linked to form collagen fibers. The process of complete collagen matrix assembly takes several months because collagen is initially deposited randomly but then is remodeled by repeated dissolution (by MMPs) and reassembly. During this remodeling period, collagen fibers orient along the lines of mechanical stress; further cross-linking adds strength to the final collagen matrix. Wound contraction is the final process of the reconstruction of new tissue. It is necessary for closure of all wounds, but especially those that heal by secondary intention. Contraction is noticeable 6 to 12 days after injury and may amount to inward movement of the wound edge by approximately 0.5 mm/day in normal healing. In granulation tissue, TGF-β induces some fibroblasts to transition into myofibroblasts, specialized cells responsible for wound contraction.41 Myofibroblasts have features of both smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. They appear microscopically similar to fibroblasts but differ in that their cytoplasm contains bundles of parallel fibers similar to those found in smooth muscle cells. Wound contraction occurs as extensions from the plasma membrane of myofibroblasts establish connections between neighboring cells, contract their fibers, and exert tension on the neighboring cells while anchoring themselves to the wound bed. Phase III: Remodeling and Maturation Tissue remodeling and maturation begins several weeks after injury and is normally complete within 2 years. During this phase, there is continuation of cellular differentiation, scar formation, and scar remodeling. The fibroblast is the major cell of tissue remodeling with the deposition of collagen into an organized matrix. Tissue regeneration and wound contraction continue in the remodeling and maturation phase—a phase for recovering normal tissue structure that can persist for years. For wounds that heal by scarring, scar tissue is remodeled and capillaries disappear, leaving the scar avascular. Within 2 to 3 weeks after maturation has begun, the scar tissue has gained about two-thirds of its eventual maximal strength. Dysfunctional Wound Healing Dysfunctional wound healing and impaired epithelialization may occur during any phase of the healing process. The causes of dysfunctional wound healing include ischemia; excessive bleeding; excessive fibrin deposition; a predisposing disorder, such as diabetes mellitus; obesity; wound infection; inadequate nutrients; numerous drugs; and tobacco smoke. Dysfunction during the Inflammatory Response Oxygen-deprived (ischemic) is susceptible to cellular death and infection, which prolongs inflammation and delays healing. Ischemia reduces energy production and impairs collagen synthesis and the tensile strength of regenerating connective tissue. Healing may be prolonged if bleeding is not stopped during acute inflammation. Hemorrhage in a damaged area delays healing for several reasons. Initially the excess blood cells that accumulate at the site of injury must be cleared—a process that requires additional time. Formation of a clot increases the amount of space that granulation tissue must fill and serves as a mechanical barrier to oxygen diffusion. Hypovolemia—decreased blood volume—hinders inflammation. The physiologic response to hypovolemia is vessel constriction rather than the dilation required to deliver inflammatory cells to the site of injury. The great amount of fibrin that is deposited during hemorrhage also must eventually be reabsorbed in order to prevent its organization into fibrous adhesions. Adhesions formed in the pleural, pericardial, or abdominal cavities, can bind organs together by fibrous bands and distort or strangulate the affected organ. Accumulated blood also serves as an excellent culture medium for bacteria, promoting continued infection and prolonging inflammation by increasing purulent exudate formation. Prolonged infection can promote excess scar formation or even prevent healing completely. Continued infection of a wound, termed wound sepsis, can be clinically treated in several ways. Most important is the débridement of necrotic tissue and foreign bodies. This removal is accomplished either through surgery or through the use of absorbent dressings. Wound irrigation and antibiotic therapy also may assist in combating continued infection. Optimal nutrition is important during all phases of healing because metabolic needs are increased. The most essential nutrients for healing are glucose, oxygen, and amino acids. Leukocytes need glucose to produce the adenosine triphosphate (5′-ATP) needed for chemotaxis, phagocytosis, intercellular killing, and initiation of healing; therefore, the wounds of persons with diabetes who receive insufficient insulin heal poorly. Persons with diabetes also are at risk for ischemic wounds because they are likely to have both small-vessel diseases that impair the microcirculation and altered (glycosylated) hemoglobin, which has an increased affinity for oxygen and thus does not readily release oxygen in tissues. Oxygen delivery is also compromised by hypoxemic states because ischemic tissue is susceptible to infection. Hypoproteinemia prolongs inflammation because the associated decrease in available amino acids is an impediment to fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. Other nutrients, including iron, zinc, manganese, copper, and vitamins A and C, also are required as cofactors for collagen synthesis. Malnutrition increases risk for wound infection, delays healing, and reduces wound tensile strength. Medications, including antineoplastic (anticancer) agents, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and steroids, delay wound healing. Antineoplastic agents slow cell division and inhibit angiogenesis. Although NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin production and suppress acute inflammation and relieve pain, they also can delay wound healing, particularly bone formation, and may contribute to the formation of excessive scarring. Antiinflammatory steroids prevent macrophages from migrating to the site of injury and inhibit release of collagenase and plasminogen activator. Steroids also inhibit fibroblast migration into the wound during the proliferative phase and delay epithelialization. Toxic agents in tobacco smoke (i.e., nicotine, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen cyanide) delay wound healing and increase the risk for wound infection. Dysfunction during the Reconstructive Phase of Healing Three of the essential processes that occur during the reconstructive phase are assembly and remodeling of the collagen matrix, epithelialization of the wound bed, and contraction of the wound. Dysfunctional wound healing can result from the impairment of any of these processes. Impaired Collagen Matrix Assembly. A number of factors may interfere with the production of collagen in healing tissues, most being nutritional. Scurvy, for example, is a condition caused by a deficiency in ascorbic acid, one of the cofactors required for the amino acid modification that is necessary for proper collagen matrix assembly. The complication of scurvy is a poorly formed collagen matrix and, therefore, greatly impaired wound healing. Other nutrients, including iron, copper, and calcium, play additional roles in the enzymatic reactions required for collagen modification and assembly. Usually, however, such minute amounts of these substances are required that deficiencies are not clinically significant. Nutritionally, appropriate protein intake is also essential for collagen synthesis. The amino acid methionine that is found in proteins is converted to cysteine, the role of which in collagen synthesis is twofold: (1) it functions as an important cofactor in the enzymatic reactions required for collagen synthesis; and (2) it contains sulfur, which contributes to formation of the strong covalent bonds in cross-linked collagen fibrils. Dysfunctional collagen synthesis may involve excessive production of collagen, causing surface “overhealing,” leading to a hypertrophic scar or keloid. A hypertrophic scar is raised but remains within the original boundaries of the wound and tends to regress over time (Fig. 7.20, A). A keloid is a raised scar that extends beyond the original boundaries of the wound, invades surrounding tissue, and is likely to recur after surgical removal (Fig. 7.20, B). A familial tendency to keloid formation has been observed, with a greater incidence in blacks than whites. FIGURE 7.20 Hypertrophic Scar and Keloid Scar Formation. Hypertrophic scar (A) and keloid scar (B) caused by excessive synthesis of collagen at suture sites. (A from Flint PW et al: Cummings otolaryngology: head & neck surgery, ed 6, Philadelphia, 2015, Mosby; B from Damjanov I, Linder J: Anderson's pathology, ed 10, St Louis, 1996, Mosby.) Similar to a keloid, a hypertrophic scar is also raised but differs in that it remains within the original boundaries of the wound. Hypertrophic scars tend to regress over time, whereas keloids do not. Both keloids and hypertrophic scars are caused by an imbalance between collagen synthesis and collagen degradation in which synthesis is increased relative to degradation. Although the precise mechanism of this imbalance is unknown, recent evidence suggests that keloid fibroblasts have lower rates of apoptosis and an inability to respond to normal suppressive feedback. Impaired Epithelialization. The process of epithelialization is suppressed by antiinflammatory steroids, hypoxemia, and nutritional deficiencies. Antiinflammatory steroids inhibit phagocyte production of the biochemical mediators required for epithelialization, hypoxemia deprives cells of the energy required for the process, and dietary zinc is necessary for the MMP activity that is crucial to cellular migration. Wound care techniques also may greatly influence epithelial cell migration. External wounds that are draining or healing by secondary intention often are clinically débrided and protected with dressings. The ideal dressing is one that absorbs some drainage without being incorporated into the clot or granulation tissue. Because epithelial cells must migrate across the wound during healing, dressings that débride healthy epithelial cells along with necrotic tissue prolong epithelialization. Many solutions that traditionally have been used to clean or irrigate wounds are now known to be deleterious to the fragile new cells in the wound bed. Normal saline is the most innocuous solution that can be used to cleanse or irrigate a wound that is healing primarily by epithelialization. Solutions such as povidone-iodine and hydrogen peroxide are desiccating (drying) and, as such, inhibit rather than promote epithelial cell migration. Impaired Contraction. Excessive wound contraction may result in a deformity or contracture. Burn wounds are especially susceptible to the development of contractures. Internal contractures may occur as well, and are common in cirrhosis of the liver. Internally, scar tissue that becomes contracted constricts blood flow that may contribute to the development of portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Other types of internal contraction deformity include duodenal strictures caused by dysfunctional healing of an ulcer and esophageal strictures caused by chemical burns. Proper positioning and range-of-motion exercises, as well as surgery, are among the physical means used to overcome the excessive myofibroblast-derived tension that results in contractures. Clinical use of pharmacologic methods for control of wound contracture is still largely experimental, but includes control of myofibroblast contraction by the administration of smooth muscle cell inhibitors such as colchicine and inhibition of proper collagen matrix assembly with drugs that prevent either collagen cross-linking or MMP activity. These latter treatments are based on the knowledge that myofibroblast binding to collagen can “lock” contracted cells into position. Wound Disruption Finally, a potential complication in the healing of wounds that are sutured closed is dehiscence, in which the wound pulls apart at the suture line. The greatest incidence of dehiscence occurs 5 to 12 days after suturing, paradoxically at the time when collagen synthesis is at its peak. Approximately 50% of dehiscence occurrences are associated with wound sepsis, although dehiscence also may occur when sutures break as a result of excessive strain. Obesity increases the risk of suture breakage because adipose tissue is difficult to suture. Wound dehiscence usually is heralded by an increase in serous drainage from the wound. In addition, patients may report a feeling that “something gave way.” Prompt surgical attention is required. Pediatrics: Innate Immunity in the Newborn Child Neonates commonly have transiently depressed inflammatory and immune function since they are being born from a sterile environment. For example, neutrophils and perhaps monocytes may not be capable of efficient chemotaxis. Insufficient response to chemotactic factors appears to be caused by lack of fluidity in the phagocyte's plasma membrane so that pseudopod formation and migration are impaired. Neonates are prone to infections associated with chemotactic defects, including cutaneous abscesses caused by staphylococci and cutaneous candidiasis. Further, neutrophils in neonates who were stressed by in utero infection or respiratory insufficiency have diminished oxidative and bacterial responses. (Acquired phagocytic defects, which may be induced by a variety of infections, metabolic disorders, nutrition deficiencies, or drugs, are described in Chapter 9.) Neonates also are partially deficient in complement, especially components of the alternative pathway. They tend to have a relative deficiency of factor B and to develop severe, overwhelming sepsis and meningitis when infected with bacteria against which there is no transferred maternal antibody. Low levels of mannose-binding lectin increase the risk for neonatal hospital-acquired sepsis. Neonates also may be deficient in some of the collectins and collectin-like proteins. This is especially true of preterm neonates. Some preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome are deficient in at least one collectin, which provides innate defense against respiratory tract infections. Aging: Innate Immunity in the Older Adult Population The older adult population is also at risk for impaired inflammation and wound healing. In some cases, impaired healing is not directly associated with aging in general but can instead be linked to a chronic illness, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus.42 Aging also alters the tissue microenvironment and macrophage function with changes in wound healing neoangiogenesis and fibrosis.43 In addition, many older adults require medications such as antiinflammatory steroids that can interfere with the healing process. Older adults have increased susceptibility to bacterial infections of the lungs, urinary tract, and skin. Because of impaired sensation or mobility and physiologic changes in the skin, older adults are at increased risk for sustaining various wounds. With aging, subcutaneous fat is lost, diminishing a layer of protection. Collagen fibers become thicker and a certain percentage of elastin is lost, further contributing to loss of protection. The regenerative capability of the skin is maintained with aging, but the epidermis undergoes ageassociated changes that include atrophy of the underlying capillaries. The consequent decrease of perfusion makes older adults more susceptible than younger people to the adverse effects of hypoxia in the wound bed. In addition, aging fibroblasts may have a slower rate of proliferation, and therefore wound healing is attenuated. Immunosenescence affects both innate and adaptive immune systems, limiting responses to both infections and vaccines. Several cellular components of innate resistance are deficient in number (e.g., alveolar macrophages) or have diminished activity (e.g., neutrophil chemotaxis, degranulation, and phagocytosis). One explanation for this diminished inflammatory cellular activity is an age-related decrease in expression and function of several, if not all, TLRs. Alterations in T cells and NK cells also occur. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) are elevated with aging and can contribute to systemic disease.44,45 Summary Review Human Defense Mechanisms 1. There are three layers of human defense: barriers; innate immunity, which includes the inflammatory response; and adaptive (acquired) immunity. First Line of Defense: Physical, Mechanical, and Biochemical Barriers and Normal Microbiome 1. Physical and mechanical barriers are the first lines of defense that prevent damage to the individual and prevent invasion by pathogens; these include the skin and mucous membranes. 2. Antibacterial peptides in mucous secretions, perspiration, saliva, tears, and other secretions provide a biochemical barrier against pathogenic microorganisms. 3. The normal bacterial flora provides protection by releasing chemicals that prevent colonization by pathogens. Second Line of Defense: Inflammation 1. Inflammation is a rapid and nonspecific protective response to cellular injury from any cause. It can occur only in vascularized tissue. 2. The macroscopic hallmarks of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, pain, and loss of function of the inflamed tissues. 3. The microscopic hallmark of inflammation is an accumulation of fluid and cells at the inflammatory site. 4. Inflammation is mediated by three key plasma protein systems: the complement system, the clotting system, and the kinin system. The components of all three systems are a series of inactive proteins that are activated sequentially. 5. The complement system can be activated by antigen-antibody reactions (through the classical pathway) or by other products, especially bacterial polysaccharides (through the lectin pathway or the alternative pathway), resulting in the production of biologically active fragments and the destruction of cells. 6. The most biologically potent products of the complement system are C3b (opsonin), C3a (anaphylatoxin), and C5a (anaphylatoxin, chemotactic factor). 7. The clotting system stops bleeding, localizes microorganisms, and provides a meshwork for repair and healing. 8. Bradykinin is the most important product of the kinin system and causes vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and pain. 9. Many different types of cells are involved in the inflammatory process including mast cells, endothelial cells, platelets, phagocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes and macrophages, dendritic cells), natural killer (NK) cells, and lymphocytes. 10. Most cells express plasma membrane pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize molecules produced by infectious microorganisms (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs), or products of cellular damage (damageassociated molecular patterns, or DAMPs). 11. The cells of the innate immune system secrete many biochemical mediators (cytokines) that are responsible for activating other cells; these cytokines include interleukins, chemokines, interferons, and other molecules. 12. The most important proinflammatory cytokines are IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). 13. Interferons are produced by cells that are infected by viruses. Once released from infected cells, interferons can stimulate neighboring healthy cells to produce substances that prevent viral infection. 14. Chemokines are synthesized by a number of different cells and induce leukocyte chemotaxis. 15. The most important activator of the inflammatory response is the mast cell, which initiates inflammation by releasing biochemical mediators (histamine, chemotactic factors) from preformed cytoplasmic granules and synthesizing other mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes) in response to a stimulus. 16. Histamine is the major vasoactive amine released from mast cells. It causes dilation of capillaries and retraction of endothelial cells lining the capillaries, which increases vascular permeability. 17. The endothelial cells lining the circulatory system (vascular endothelium) normally regulate circulating components of the inflammatory system and maintain normal blood flow by preventing spontaneous activation of platelets and members of the clotting system. 18. During inflammation the endothelium expresses receptors that help leukocytes leave the vessel and retract to allow fluid to pass into the tissues. 19. Platelets interact with the coagulation cascade to stop bleeding and release a number of mediators that promote and control inflammation. 20. The polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN), the predominant phagocytic cell in the early inflammatory response, exits the circulation by diapedesis through the retracted endothelial cell junctions and moves to the inflammatory site by chemotaxis. 21. Eosinophils release products that control the inflammatory response and are the principal cell that kills parasitic organisms. 22. The macrophage, the predominant phagocytic cell in the late inflammatory response, is highly phagocytic, is responsive to cytokines, and promotes wound healing. 23. Dendritic cells connect the innate and acquired immune systems by collecting antigens at the site of inflammation and transporting them to sites, such as the lymph nodes, where immunocompetent B and T cells reside. 24. Phagocytosis is a multistep cellular process for the elimination of pathogens and foreign debris. The steps include recognition and attachment, engulfment, formation of a phagosome and phagolysosome, and destruction of pathogens or foreign debris. Phagocytic cells engulf microorganisms and enclose them in phagocytic vacuoles (phagolysosomes), within which toxic products (especially metabolites of oxygen) and degradative lysosomal enzymes kill and digest the microorganisms. 25. Opsonins, such as antibody and complement component C3b, coat microorganisms and make them more susceptible to phagocytosis by binding them more tightly to the phagocyte. Local Manifestations of Inflammation 1. Local manifestations of inflammation are the result of the vascular changes associated with the inflammatory process, including vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. The symptoms include redness, heat, swelling, and pain. Systemic Manifestations of Acute Inflammation 1. The principal systemic effects of inflammation are fever and increases in levels of circulating leukocytes (leukocytosis) and plasma proteins (acute-phase reactants). Chronic Inflammation 1. Chronic inflammation can be a continuation of acute inflammation that lasts 2 weeks or longer. It also can occur as a distinct process without much preceding acute inflammation. 2. Chronic inflammation is characterized by a dense infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages. The body may wall off and isolate the infection to protect against tissue damage by formation of a granuloma. Wound Healing 1. Resolution (regeneration) is the return of tissue to nearly normal structure and function. Repair is healing by scar tissue formation. 2. Damaged tissue proceeds to resolution (restoration of the original tissue structure and function) if little tissue has been lost or injured tissue is capable of regeneration. This is called healing by primary intention. 3. Tissues that sustained extensive damage or those incapable of regeneration heal by the process of repair, resulting in the formation of a scar. This is called healing by secondary intention. 4. Resolution and repair occur in two separate phases: the reconstructive phase in which the wound begins to heal and the maturation phase in which the healed wound is remodeled. 5. Dysfunctional wound healing can be related to ischemia, excessive bleeding, excessive fibrin deposition, a predisposing disorder (such as diabetes mellitus), wound infection, inadequate nutrients, numerous drugs, or altered collagen synthesis. 6. Dehiscence is a disruption in which the wound pulls apart at the suture line. 7. A contracture is a deformity caused by the excessive shortening of collagen in scar tissue. Pediatrics: Innate Immunity in the Newborn Child 1. Neonates often have transiently depressed inflammatory function, particularly neutrophil chemotaxis and alternative complement pathway activity. Aging: Innate Immunity in the Older Adult Population 1. Older adults are at risk for impaired wound healing, usually because of chronic illnesses. 2. Alterations in both the innate and the adaptive immune systems occur with aging and affect responses to inflammation, infection, and vaccination. Key Terms α1-Antitrypsin, 209 α2-Macroglobulin, 209 Abscess, 210 Acquired immunity, 190 Acute-phase reactant, 210 Adaptive immunity, 190 Adhesion, 214 Adhesion molecule, 202 Alternative pathway, 196 Anaphylatoxin, 198 Angiogenesis factor, 212 Antigen-antibody complex (immune complex), 196 Antimicrobial lectin, 193 Antimicrobial peptide, 192 Bactericidal/permeability-inducing (BPI) protein, 193 Basophil, 203, 206 Bradykinin, 198 C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-inh), 199 C3 convertase, 196 C5 convertase, 196 C3b receptor, 207 Carboxypeptidase, 198, 199 Cathelicidin, 192 Cell adhesion molecule (CAM), 207 Cell lysis, 198 Chemokine, 201, 203 Chemotactic factor, 198 Chemotaxis, 203 Classical pathway, 196 Coagulation cascade, 198 Collagen, 212 Collectin, 192 Complement cascade, 196 Complement receptor, 200 Complement system, 196 Contraction, 212 Contracture, 215 Cyst, 210 Cytokine, 200 Damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), 200 Débridement, 212 Defensin, 192 Dehiscence, 215 Dendritic cell, 206 Diapedesis, 207 Endogenous pyrogen, 210 Endothelial cell, 205, 207 Eosinophil, 206 Eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A), 203 Epithelial-derived chemical, 191 Epithelialization, 212 Epithelioid cell, 211 Exudate, 210 Fc receptor, 207 Fever, 210 Fibrinolytic system, 199 Fibrinous exudate, 210 Fibroblast, 212 Giant cell, 211 Granulation tissue, 212 Granulocyte, 200 Granuloma, 211 Hageman factor (factor XII), 198 Heat, 209 Hemorrhagic exudate, 210 Hereditary angioedema, 199 Hexose-monophosphate shunt, 209 Histaminase, 199 Histamine, 203 Hypertrophic scar, 215 Inflammasome, 200 Inflammation, 190, 194 Inflammatory phase, 212 Inflammatory response, 191, 194 Innate immunity, 190 Integrin, 200, 207 Interferon (IFN), 203 Interleukin (IL), 201 Interleukin-1 (IL-1), 201 Interleukin-6 (IL-6), 202 Interleukin-10 (IL-10), 202 Keloid, 215 Kinin system, 198 Kininase, 198 Lectin pathway, 196 Leukocytosis, 210 Leukotriene, 203 Macrophage, 206 Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), 192 Margination (pavementing), 207 Mast cell, 203 Mast cell degranulation, 198 Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), 212 Maturation phase, 214 Monocyte, 206 Myofibroblast, 214 Native immunity, 190 Natural barrier, 191 Natural immunity, 190 Natural killer (NK) cell, 209 Neutrophil, 206 Neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF), 203 Nitric oxide (NO), 205 NOD-like receptor (NLR), 200 Normal microbiome, 193 Opsonin, 198 Opsonization, 207 Pain, 210 Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), 200 Pattern recognition receptor (PRR), 200 Phagocyte, 206 Phagocytosis, 206 Phagolysosome, 208 Phagosome, 208 Plasma kinin cascade, 198 Plasma protein system, 196 Plasmin, 199 Plasminogen, 199 Platelet, 205 Platelet-activating factor (PAF), 205 Polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN), 206 Primary intention, 212 Primary lysosomal granule, 208 Proenzyme, 196 Proliferative phase, 212 Prostaglandin, 203 Purulent (suppurative) exudate, 210 Reconstructive phase, 214 Redness, 209 Regeneration, 212 Repair, 212 Resistin-like molecule β, 193 Resolution, 212 Scar tissue, 212 Scavenger receptor, 200 Secondary granule, 208 Secondary intention, 212 Selectin, 207 Serous, 210 Slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), 203 Specific immunity, 190 Swelling, 210 Toll-like receptor (TLR), 200 Transforming growth factor, 203 Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), 203, 212 Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), 202 Wound contraction, 214 Wound healing, 212 References 1.

Once constitutive protective mechanisms at external barriers (first line of defense) have been compromised and inflammation (see Chapter 7) has been activated (second line of defense), the adaptive immune response is called into action. Thus inflammation is the “first responder” that contains the initial injury and slows spread of infection, whereas adaptive immunity is the “secondary responder” that augments the initial defenses against infection and provides longterm security against reinfection. Innate immunity, especially inflammation, and adaptive immunity are highly interactive and complementary. Components of innate resistance are necessary for the development of the adaptive immune response. Conversely, products of the adaptive immune response activate components of the innate immune system. Thus both systems are essential for complete protection against infectious disease. FIGURE 8.1 Scanning Electron Micrograph Showing Lymphocytes (Yellow), Red Blood Cells, and Platelets. (Copyright Dennis Kunkel Microscopy, Inc.) Inflammation and adaptive immunity differ in several key ways. First, adaptive immunity develops more slowly than inflammation. The components of inflammation preexist in the blood and tissues and are activated immediately after and as a result of tissue damage. Adaptive immunity is inducible. The effectors of the immune response, lymphocytes and antibodies, do not preexist but must be produced in response to infection. Second, each inflammatory response is similar (although not identical) regardless of differences in the cause of tissue damage or whether the inflammatory site is sterile or contaminated with microorganisms. The adaptive immune response is exquisitely specific. The lymphocytes and antibodies induced in response to a particular infectious agent are extremely specific to that agent. A different infectious agent will induce a different battery of lymphocytes and antibodies. Third, the residual mediators of inflammation must be removed quickly to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissue and allow healing. The effectors of the adaptive immune response are long-lived and systemic, providing long-term protection against a specific infectious agent. Fourth, activation of the inflammatory response to recurrent tissue damage or repeated infection with the same microorganism is generally identical. The adaptive immune response has memory. If reinfected with the same microorganism, protective lymphocytes and antibody are produced rapidly, thus providing permanent long-term protection. Thus the adaptive immune response is distinguished by being inducible, specific, and long-lived, and by having memory. The collaborative and beneficial nature of inflammation and adaptive immunity can, on occasion, fail. Chapter 9 discusses these medically relevant aberrations in both inflammation and immunity, including allergies, diseases that involve unwanted immunologic destruction of healthy tissue, and diseases that are caused by a deficiency in the normal immune or inflammatory responses. Chapter 10 presents an overview of infection and Chapter 11 discusses the connection between stress and disease and the interrelatedness of the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems. General Characteristics of Adaptive Immunity The adaptive immune system has its own vocabulary (Fig. 8.2). The immune system of the normal adult is continually challenged by a spectrum of substances that it may recognize as foreign, or “nonself.” These substances, called foreign antigens, are often associated with pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites, although they are also found on noninfectious environmental agents such as pollens, foods, and bee venom, and still others are associated with clinically derived drugs, vaccines, transfusions, and transplanted tissues (Table 8.1). The products (i.e., effectors) of the adaptive immune response include antibodies (sometimes called immunoglobulins) and lymphocytes that are specific for particular antigens. FIGURE 8.2 Overview of Immune Response. The immune response can be separated into two phases: the generation of clonal diversity and clonal selection. During the generation of clonal diversity, lymphoid stem cells from the bone marrow migrate to the central lymphoid organs (the thymus or regions of the bone marrow), where they undergo a series of cellular division and differentiation stages resulting in either immunocompetent T cells from the thymus or immunocompetent B cells from the bone marrow. (This process is outlined in more detail in Figs. 8.9 and 8.12.) These cells are still naïve in that they have never encountered foreign antigen. The immunocompetent cells enter the circulation and migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs (e.g., spleen and lymph nodes), where they take up residence in B- and T-cell–rich areas. The clonal selection phase is initiated by exposure to foreign antigen. The antigen is usually processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for presentation to helper T cells (Th cells) (more detail in Fig. 8.16). The intercellular cooperation among APCs, Th cells, and immunocompetent T and B cells results in a second stage of cellular proliferation and differentiation (more details in Figs. 8.18 and 8.21). Because antigen has “selected” those T and B cells with compatible antigen receptors, only a small population of T and B cells undergoes this process at one time. The result is an active cellular immunity or humoral immunity, or both. Cellular immunity is mediated by a population of “effector” T cells that can kill targets (cytotoxic T cells) or regulate the immune response (T-regulatory cells), as well as a population of memory cells (memory T cells) that can respond more quickly to a second challenge with the same antigen. Humoral immunity is mediated by a population of soluble proteins (antibodies) produced by plasma cells and by a population of memory B cells that can produce more antibody rapidly to a second challenge with the same antigen. TABLE 8.1 CLINICAL USE OF ANTIGEN OR ANTIBODY CLINICAL USE OF ANTIGEN OR ANTIBODY ANTIGEN SOURCE PROTECTION: COMBAT ACTIVE DISEASE PROTECTION: DIAGNOSIS VACCINATION THERAPY Infectious agents Neutralize or destroy pathogenic microorganisms (e.g., antibody response against viral infections) Induce safe and protective immune response (e.g., recommended childhood vaccines) Measure circulating antigen from infectious agent or antibody (e.g., diagnosis of hepatitis B infection) Passive treatment with antibody to treat or prevent infection (e.g., administration of antibody against hepatitis A) Cancers Prevent tumor growth or spread (e.g., immune surveillance to prevent early cancers) Prevent cancer growth or spread (e.g., vaccination with cancer antigens) Measure circulating antigen (e.g., circulating PSA for diagnosis of prostate cancer) Immunotherapy (e.g., treatment of cancer with antibodies against cancer antigens) Environmental substances Prevent entrance into body (e.g., secretory IgA limits systemic exposure to potential allergens) No clear example Measure circulating antigen or antibody (e.g., diagnosis of allergy by measuring circulating IgE) Immunotherapy (e.g., administration of antigen for desensitization of individuals with severe allergies) Self-antigens Immune system Some cases of Measure tolerance to selfvaccination alter circulating antigens, which may tolerance to selfantibody be altered by an antigens leading against selfinfectious agent to autoimmune antigen for leading to disease diagnosis of autoimmune disease autoimmune (see Chapter 9) disease (see Chapter 9) No clear example IgA, Immunoglobulin A; PSA, prostate-specific antigen. Specificity and memory are primary characteristics that differentiate the immune response from other protective mechanisms. This chapter first discusses the nature of that specificity by defining the various types of antigens recognized by the immune system, the ways in which they are recognized by antibodies and lymphocytes, and the specific intercellular recognition molecules that are necessary for effective immune responses. After the recognition molecules are defined, the development of the immune response is discussed. An immune response can be divided into two phases (see Fig. 8.2). In the fetus, well before being exposed to any infectious microorganisms, lymphocytes undergo extensive differentiation and proliferation. These events occur in the primary lymphoid organs (thymus and bone marrow). Some lymphoid stem cells in humans enter the thymus and differentiate into T lymphocytes (T cells, T indicating thymus derived) and others enter specific regions in the bone marrow and differentiate into B lymphocytes (B cells, B indicating bone marrow derived). Each type of cell develops origin-specific cell surface proteins that identify them as T or B cells. Both B and T cells also develop cell surface antigen receptors. The receptors are remarkable because an individual B or T cell is programmed to recognize only one specific antigen before having encountered that antigen. It is estimated that each person has produced a population of B and T cells with an extensive diversity of antigen receptors capable of recognizing at least 108 different antigens. This process is called generation of clonal diversity (see Fig. 8.2). Lymphocytes leave the primary lymphoid organs as immunocompetent but naïve B and T cells. They are immunocompetent in that they have the capacity to respond to antigen, but naïve in that they have not yet encountered antigen. These cells enter the blood and lymphatic vessels and migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs (e.g., lymph nodes, spleen) of the systemic immune system (Fig. 8.3). Some take up residence in B-cell– and T-cell–rich areas of those organs and others reenter the circulation. Approximately 60% to 70% of circulating lymphocytes are immunocompetent T cells, and 10% to 20% are immunocompetent B cells. FIGURE 8.3 Lymphoid Tissues: Sites of B-Cell and T-Cell Differentiation. Immature lymphocytes migrate through central (primary) lymphoid tissues: the bone marrow (central lymphoid tissue for B lymphocytes) and the thymus (central lymphoid tissue for T lymphocytes). Mature lymphocytes later reside in the T- and B-lymphocyte–rich areas of the peripheral (secondary) lymphoid tissues. The second phase, called clonal selection, is initiated by exposure to foreign antigen usually related to infection (see Fig. 8.2). Antigen reacts with, or selects, clones of B and T cells with surface receptors against that specific antigen and initiates a process of further differentiation and proliferation into mature effector cells. The process requires the cooperation among a variety of cells in the secondary lymphoid organs; most antigens need to be processed (antigen processing) by phagocytic cells, primarily dendritic cells, that also present the processed antigen on their surfaces and present (antigen presentation) the antigen to lymphocytes. These cells are generally called antigen-processing or antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Thus begins a symphony of cellular interactions that define clonal selection, involving APCs and several subsets of B and T cells, intercellular adhesion through antigen receptors and specific intercellular adhesion molecules, the production and response to multiple cytokines, and eventual differentiation of immunocompetent B and T cells into highly specialized effector cells. B cells develop into plasma cells that become factories for the production of antibody. T cells develop into several subsets that identify and kill a target cell (T-cytotoxic cell [Tc cell]), regulate the immune response by helping the clonal selection process (T-helper cell [Th cell]), or suppress or limit the immune response (T-regulatory cell [Treg cell]). Both B and T cells also differentiate into very long-lived memory cells that exist for decades or, in some cases, the life of the individual. Memory cells “remember” the initial antigen and are rapidly activated if a second exposure occurs to the same microorganism. Humoral and Cell-Mediated Immunity The immune response has two arms: antibody and T cells, both of which protect against infection. Antibody circulates in the blood and in secretions and defends against extracellular microbes found in those fluids and microbial toxins. This interaction can result in direct inactivation of the microorganism or activation of a variety of inflammatory mediators (e.g., complement, phagocytes) that will destroy the pathogen. Antibody is primarily responsible for protection against many bacteria and viruses. This arm of the immune response is termed the humoral immune response, or humoral immunity. Effector T cells are found in the blood and in tissues and organs and defend against intracellular pathogens (e.g., some viruses) and cancer cells. T cells may produce cytokines that stimulate the protective response of other leukocytes. Others develop into Tc cells that attack and kill cellular targets directly. This arm of the immune response is termed the cellular immune response, or cellular immunity. The humoral and cellular immune responses are interdependent at many levels. In the end, the success of an acquired immune response depends on the functions of both the humoral and the cellular responses, as well as the appropriate interactions between them. Active vs. Passive Immunity Adaptive immunity can be either active or passive, depending on whether the antibodies or T cells are produced by the individual in response to antigen or are administered directly. Active immunity (active acquired immunity) is produced by an individual either after natural exposure to an antigen or after immunization, whereas passive immunity (passive acquired immunity) does not involve the host's immune response at all. Rather, passive immunity occurs when preformed antibodies or T lymphocytes are transferred from a donor to the recipient. This can occur naturally, as in the passage of maternal antibodies across the placenta to the fetus, or artificially, as in a clinic using immunotherapy for a specific disease. Unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to particular infectious agents (e.g., hepatitis A virus, rabies virus) often will be given immunoglobulins that are prepared from individuals who already have antibodies against that particular pathogen (see Table 8.1). Whereas active acquired immunity is longlived, passive immunity is only temporary because the donor's antibodies or T cells are eventually destroyed. Recognition and Response The foundation of any successful immune response is the specific recognition of antigen by antibody or receptors on the surface of B or T cells, followed by a set of complex intercellular communications among a variety of APCs and lymphocytes. To fully understand the immune response, it is necessary to initially understand the basis for that recognition. Many of the molecules discussed in this chapter are part of a nomenclature that uses the prefix “CD” followed by a number (e.g., CD1 or CD2) (Table 8.2). The definition of the CD (cluster of differentiation) format has changed over time. It was originally used to describe proteins found on the surface of lymphocytes. Currently, CD is the accepted format for labeling a very large family of proteins found on the surface of many cells. Many have alternative names related to their function, which may be used in this chapter. The list of identified molecules is constantly increasing (the number of molecules with a CD designation is probably in excess of 370). In a similar fashion, the list of known cytokines is continually growing, with more than 70 having been identified so far. A large number of CD molecules and cytokines contribute to the acquired immune response. This book attempts to focus on a small number of highly important examples to illustrate the immensely complicated, but highly effective, interactions that take place to produce a protective immune response.

Antigens and Immunogens Initially, we need to understand the molecules against which an immune response is directed. Although the terms antigen and immunogen are commonly used as synonyms, there are clinically important differences between the two. Antigen is a commonly used term to describe a molecule that can react with binding sites on antibodies or antigen receptors on B and T cells. Most, but not all, antigens are also immunogens. An antigen that is immunogenic will induce an immune response, resulting in the production of antibodies or functional T cells. Thus a substance may be antigenic yet not be immunogenic. The precise portion of the antigen that is configured for recognition and binding is called its antigenic determinant, or epitope. The matching portion on the antibody or the lymphocyte receptor is sometimes referred to as the antigen-binding site, or paratope. The size of an antigenic determinant is relatively small, perhaps just a few amino acids or carbohydrate residues on the surface of a large molecule (Fig. 8.4). Antigenic determinants may be linear or conformational. For instance, linear antigenic determinants consist of amino acids (or other chemicals) that are adjacent in the molecule's primary structure; thus they are stable when the molecule is denatured. Conformational antigenic determinants consist of amino acids that are only adjacent when the molecule is folded appropriately. When the molecule is denatured or processed, that antigenic determinant is destroyed. Therefore macromolecules (e.g., proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids) usually contain multiple and diverse antigenic determinants, and the immune response against the macromolecule will usually consist of a mixture of specific antibodies against several of these determinants. FIGURE 8.4 Antigenic Determinants (Epitopes). Shown are generic examples of linear epitopes on protein (A) and polysaccharide (B) molecules and conformational epitopes on protein (C). In A, an antigenic protein may have multiple different epitopes (epitopes 1 and 2) that react with different antibodies. Each sphere represents an amino acid, with the yellow spheres representing epitope 1 and the red spheres representing epitope 2. Individual epitopes may consist of eight or nine amino acids. In B, a polysaccharide is constructed of a backbone with branched side chains. Each sphere represents an individual carbohydrate, with the yellow spheres representing the carbohydrates that form the epitope. In this example, two identical epitopes are shown that would bind two identical antibodies. In C, an epitope consists of amino acids from different portions of the primary sequence that are placed near each other during folding of the molecule. When the molecule is denatured, the epitope is destroyed. Certain criteria influence the degree to which an antigen is immunogenic. These include (1) being foreign to the host, (2) being appropriate in size, (3) having an adequate chemical complexity, and (4) being present in a sufficient quantity. Foremost among the criteria for immunogenicity is the antigen's foreignness. A self-antigen is part of the individual's makeup that fulfills all these criteria except foreignness and does not normally elicit an immune response. Thus most individuals are tolerant to their own antigens. The immune system has an exquisite ability to distinguish self (self-antigens) from nonself (foreign antigens). Tolerance was once thought to be a state of nonresponsiveness in which the immune system passively allowed self-antigens to persist, but tolerance is now known to have a variety of mechanisms. In some cases, a state of central tolerance exists, in which lymphocytes with receptors against self-antigens have been eliminated during generation of clonal diversity. In other cases, tolerance is peripheral tolerance that is mediated by Treg cells (see Fig. 8.2). Rather than merely tolerating some self-antigens, the immune system actively prevents or limits their recognition by lymphocytes and antibodies. Some pathogens have developed a survival advantage by their capacity to mimic selfantigens and avoid inducing an immune response. Molecular size also contributes to an antigen's immunogenicity. In general, large molecules (those bigger than 10,000 daltons), such as proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids, are most immunogenic. Low-molecular-weight molecules, such as amino acids, monosaccharides, fatty acids, and the purine and pyrimidine bases, tend to be unable to induce an immune response. Many small molecules can function as haptens: antigens that are too small to be immunogenic by themselves but become immunogenic after binding with larger molecules that function as carriers for the hapten. For example, the antigens of penicillin (a β-lactam antibiotic of about 243 daltons) and poison ivy (which contains urushiol, an oily sap of about 1500 daltons) are haptens, but they initiate allergic responses only after binding to large-molecular-weight proteins in the allergic individual's blood or skin. Antigens that induce an allergic response are also called allergens. Allergic conditions are discussed in Chapter 9. Chemical complexity affects immunogenicity. The best immunogens contain a diversity of chemically different components. For instance, a large synthetic protein consisting only of the amino acid alanine would not be very immunogenic despite its size and foreignness. However, if other amino acids, such as tyrosine, tryptophan, or phenylalanine, were inserted into the structure, the degree of immunogenicity would increase greatly. Finally, antigens that are present in extremely small or large quantities may be unable to elicit an immune response and therefore by definition are also nonimmunogenic. In many cases, exposure to high or low extremes of antigen quantities may induce a state of tolerance rather than immunity. Even if an antigen fulfills all these criteria, the quality and intensity of the immune response may still be affected by a variety of additional factors. For example, the route and vehicle of antigenic entry or administration are critical to the immunogenicity of some antigens. This has important clinical implications. The most common routes for clinical administration of antigen, such as vaccines, are intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intranasal, and oral. Each route preferentially stimulates a different set of lymphocyte-containing (lymphoid) tissues and therefore results in the induction of different types of cell-mediated or humoral immune responses. For some vaccines, the route may affect the protectiveness of the immune response so that the individual is protected if immunized by one route, but may remain susceptible to infection if administered through a different route. Immunogenicity of an antigen also may be altered by being delivered along with substances that stimulate the immune response; these substances are known as adjuvants. Finally, the genetic makeup of a host can play a critical role in the immune system's ability to respond to many antigens; some individuals appear to be unable to respond to immunization with a particular antigen, whereas they respond well to other antigens. For instance, a small percentage of the population may fail to produce a measurable immune response to a common vaccine, despite multiple injections, whereas they will respond well to a different vaccine. Many other factors can modulate the immune response. These include the individual's age, nutritional status, and reproductive status, as well as the exposure to traumatic injury, the presence of concurrent disease, or the use of immunosuppressive medications. These are discussed further in Chapter 9. Molecules That Recognize Antigen Antigen is directly recognized by three molecules: circulating antibody and antigen receptors on the surface of B lymphocytes (Bcell receptor, or BCR) and T lymphocytes (T-cell receptor, or TCR) (Fig. 8.5). FIGURE 8.5 Antigen-Binding Molecules. Antigen-binding molecules include soluble antibody (A, B, C) and cell surface receptors (D). A, The typical antibody molecule consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains connected by interchain disulfide bonds (– between chains in the figure). Each heavy chain is divided into three regions with relatively constant amino acid sequences (CH1, CH2, and CH3) and a region with a variable amino acid sequence (VH). Each light chain is divided into a constant region (CL) and a variable region (VL). The hinge region (Hi) provides flexibility in some classes of antibody. Within each variable region are three highly variable complementary-determining regions (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3) separated by relatively constant framework regions (FRs). B, Fragmentation of the antibody molecule by limited digestion with the enzyme papain has identified three important portions of the molecule: a fragment crystallizable (Fc) and two identical fragment antigen binding (Fab) fragments. Both Fab fragments bind antigen. As the antibody folds (C), the CDRs are placed in proximity to form the antigenbinding site. D, The antigen receptor on the surface of B cells (BCR complex) is a monomeric antibody with a structure similar to that of circulating antibody, with an additional hydrophobic transmembrane region (TM) that anchors the molecule to the cell surface. The active BCR complex contains molecules (Igα and Igβ) that are responsible for intracellular signaling after the receptor has bound antigen. The T-cell receptor (TCR) consists of an α chain and a β chain joined by a disulfide bond. Each chain consists of a constant region (Cα and Cβ) and a variable region (Vα and Vβ). Each variable region contains CDRs and FRs in a structure similar to that of antibody. The active TCR is associated with several molecules that are responsible for intracellular signaling. These include CD3, which is a complex of γ (gamma), ε (epsilon), and δ (delta) subunits, and a complex of two ζ (zeta) molecules. The ζ molecules are attached to a cytoplasmic protein kinase (ZAP70) that is critical to intracellular signaling. (C adapted from Patton KT, Thibodeau GA: Anatomy & physiology, ed 9, St Louis, 2016, Mosby.) Antibody An understanding of antibodies and how they react with antigen will provide a foundation for more complex topics, such as the B-cell and T-cell receptors for antigen. An antibody, or immunoglobulin, is a serum glycoprotein produced by plasma cells in response to a challenge by an immunogen. The term immunoglobulin is used as a generic description of a general group of antibodies, whereas the term antibody commonly denotes one particular set of immunoglobulins known to have specificity for a specific antigen. Classes. There are five molecular classes of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, and IgD) that are characterized by differences in antigenicity, structure, and function. Within two of the immunoglobulin classes are several distinct subclasses including four subclasses of IgG and two subclasses of IgA (Table 8.3). TABLE 8.3 PROPERTIES OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS IgG IgM IgA sIgA Physiochemical Properties of Immunoglobulins Subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 IgM IgA1, IgA2 IgA1, IgA2 Heavy chain γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4 µ α1, α2 α1, α2 MW 146,000 970,000 160,000 385,000 Serum levels* 850, 290, 95, 50 135 290, 50 5 Biologic Properties of Immunoglobulins Complement activation Yes IgG3 > IgG1 > IgG2 Yes No No Fc binds to phagocytes Yes IgG1, IgG3 No No No Fc binds to mast Yes IgG4 cells No No No Fc binds to platelets Yes No No No Placental transfer Yes IgG1 = IgG3 > IgG4 > IgG2 No No No Toxin neutralization, complement activation, opsonization, longterm immunity Initial antibody produced, agglutination, complement fixation, B-cell receptor Neutralization In secretions, toxin and bacterial neutralization Biologic Function *Average adult levels (mg/dL) arranged by subclass. Fc, Fragment crystallizable; MW, molecular weight in daltons. IgG is the most abundant class of immunoglobulins, constituting 80% to 85% of those circulating in the body and accounting for most of the protective activity against infections (see Table 8.3). Maternal IgG is transported across the placenta during pregnancy and protects the newborn child during the first 6 months of life. Four subclasses of IgG have been described: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgA can be divided into two subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2. IgA1 molecules are found predominantly in the blood, whereas IgA2 is the predominant class of antibody found in normal body secretions (secretory IgA [sIgA]). sIgA molecules are dimers anchored together through a J chain and “secretory piece.” This secretory piece is attached to the IgA dimer inside mucosal epithelial cells and protects these immunoglobulins against degradation by enzymes also found in the secretions. IgM is the largest of the immunoglobulins and usually exists as a pentamer (a molecule consisting of five identical smaller molecules) that is stabilized by a J (joining) chain. It is the first antibody produced during the initial, or primary, response to antigen. IgM is usually synthesized early in neonatal life, but may be increased as a response to infection in utero. Information on the role of IgD is limited. This class of immunoglobulins is found in very low concentrations in the blood. IgD functions as an antigen receptor on the surface of early B lymphocytes. IgE is normally at low concentrations in the circulation. It functions as a mediator of many common allergic responses (see Chapter 9) and in the defense against parasitic infections. Molecular Structure. Structural analysis of immunoglobulins began with Porter's early studies on the effects of the enzyme papain to digest IgG.1 IgG was cleaved into three fragments, two of which were identical. The two identical fragments retained the ability to bind antigen, and each was termed an antigen-binding fragment (Fab).2 The third fragment crystallized when separated from the Fab portions and was termed the crystalline fragment (Fc) (see Fig. 8.5). The Fab portions contain identical recognition sites (receptors) for antigenic determinants and confer the molecule's specificity toward a particular antigen. The Fc portion is responsible for most of the biologic functions of antibodies that have bound antigen, including activation of the complement cascade and opsonization by binding to Fc receptors on the surface of the cells of the innate immune system. The basic structure of an antibody molecule consists of four polypeptide chains—two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains (see Fig. 8.5). The class of antibody is determined by which heavy chain is used: gamma (IgG), mu (IgM), alpha (IgA), epsilon (IgE), or delta (IgD). The light chains of an antibody molecule are of either the kappa (κ) or the lambda (λ) type. The light and heavy chains are held together by two major forces: noncovalent bonds and disulfide linkages. A set of disulfide bridges between the heavy chains occurs in the hinge region and in some instances lends a degree of molecular flexibility at that site so that the Fab regions can move. An individual plasma cell produces only one type of H chain and one type of L chain at a time; for instance, one plasma cell may produce only IgGκ, whereas other plasma cells will be producing other antibody classes with either κ or λ light chains. Light and heavy chains are further subdivided into constant (C) and variable (V) regions. The constant regions have relatively stable amino acid sequences within a particular immunoglobulin class or subclass or a particular light chain type. Thus the amino acid sequence of the constant region of one IgG1 heavy chain should be almost identical with the sequence of the same region of another IgG1 heavy chain, even if they react with different antigens. This holds true for light chains also; all λ chains possess highly similar constant regions that differ from those in κ chains. The amino acid sequences of the variable regions in heavy and light chains, however, differ greatly and determine the antigen-binding specificity of the molecule. Therefore two IgG1 molecules against different antigens may have similar constant regions but have many differences in the amino acid sequence of their variable regions. The diversity of amino acid sequences in the variable region is localized into three regions of the variable region. These three areas were once called hypervariable regions, but are now called complementary-determining regions (CDRs). The four regions separating the CDRs have relatively stable amino acid sequences and are called framework regions (FRs). Antigen Binding The antigen-binding site is formed by folding an antibody molecule so that the CDRs of the variable regions of both the heavy (VH) and the light (VL) chains are moved into close proximity, resulting in a binding site that is lined by the three CDRs of the heavy chain and the three CDRs of the light chain (see Fig. 8.5). Most proteins will naturally fold and take on secondary or tertiary structures. The FRs control the accuracy of folding in the variable regions of antibodies so that the CDRs in both variable regions are placed into accurate positions to bind antigen.3 The specificity of an antibody toward a particular antigen is determined by the chemical nature of the particular amino acids in the six CDRs and the shape of the binding site. The antigen that will bind most strongly must have complementary chemistry and topography with the binding site formed by the antibody.4 The antigen fits into this binding site with the specificity of a key into a lock and is held there by noncovalent chemical interactions (Fig. 8.6). In some cases the substitution of a single critical amino acid in a CDR may have a significant effect on the shape of the binding site and the specificity of the antibody molecule. FIGURE 8.6 Antigen-Antibody Binding. The specificity required for antibody binding with an antigen is determined by the shape and chemistry of the six complementary-determining regions (CDRs) in the combining site on the variable region of the antibody. This figure indicates two different antibodies (Fab portions of antibody 1 and antibody 2) that have different sets of CDRs and therefore different specificities. As indicated, the antigenic determinant that reacts well with antibody 1 is unable to react with antibody 2 because of differences in the antibody combining site. CH, Constant region of the heavy chain; CL, constant region of the light chain; Fab, antigen-binding fragment; V, variable; VH, variable heavy chain; VL, variable light chain. Because the heavy and light chains are identical within the same antibody molecule, the two binding sites are also identical and have specificity for the same antigen. The number of functional antigenbinding sites is called the antibody's valence. Most antibody classes (i.e., IgG, IgE, IgD, and circulating IgA) have a valence of 2, but secretory IgA has a valence of 4. IgM, being a pentamer, has a theoretical valence of 10, but can simultaneously use only about 5 binding sites because a large antigenic molecule binding to 1 site blocks antigen binding to other sites. B-Cell Receptor Complex The B-cell receptor (BCR) is a complex of antibody bound to the cell surface and other molecules involved in intracellular signaling (see Fig. 8.5). Its role is to recognize antigen and communicate that information to the cell's nucleus. Therefore the BCR complex consists of antigen-recognition molecules and accessory molecules involved in intracellular signaling (Igα and Igβ). BCRs on the surface of immunocompetent B cells are membrane-associated IgM (mIgM) with or without IgD (mIgD) immunoglobulins. The immunoglobulin portion of the BCR is produced from the same genes used by plasma cells for soluble antibodies and has the same antigen specificity as circulating antibodies produced from the same cell after clonal selection. As a BCR, however, mIgM is a monomer rather than the pentamer, and both mIgM and mIgD express an extra hydrophobic transmembrane region that anchors to the hydrophobic regions of the plasma membrane. The BCR signaling complex consists of two Igα and Igβ heterodimers that are closely associated with the BCR and contain tyrosine kinase signaling activity. The antibody portion of the BCR complex is responsible for recognition and binding to an antigen, but by itself cannot provide the intracellular signals required to activate the B cell and complete its maturation into antibody-producing plasma cells. That message is conveyed by the Igα and Igβ heterodimers. T-Cell Receptor Complex T lymphocytes use a similar but distinct array of proteins in their recognition and response to antigens. The T-cell receptor (TCR) complex is composed of an antibody-like transmembrane protein (TCR) and a group of accessory proteins (collectively referred to as CD3) that are involved in intracellular signaling (see Fig. 8.5). The most common TCR resembles an antibody Fab region and consists of two protein chains, α and β chains, each of which has a variable and constant region and is encoded from genes located independently of the antibody heavy and light chains. Similar to the BCR, the TCR is responsible for recognition and binding to the antigen, whereas the accessory proteins are responsible for the intracellular signaling necessary for activation and differentiation of the T cell. Each of the individual components of the TCR complex is important, and several severe defects in the T-cell immune response have been related to mutations in individual components of the complex (see Chapter 9). Molecules That Present Antigen For an effective immune response, most antigens must be processed by APCs and presented on the cell surface by specialized molecules, molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Fig. 8.7). MHC molecules in humans also are called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) (discussed in greater detail in Chapter 9 related to their role in transplantation). Some types of antigen are processed only by highly specialized cells: APCs. Other types of antigen can be processed and presented by almost any type of cell. Several sets of cell surface molecules have the responsibility for appropriately presenting antigen. These molecules are described next. FIGURE 8.7 Genetics and Structure of Antigen-Presenting Molecules. Three sets of molecules are primarily responsible for antigen presentation: MHC class I, MHC class II, and CD1. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are encoded from the MHC region on chromosome 6, which contains information for class I and class II molecules, as well as for several other molecules that participate in the innate or immune responses. These include several complement proteins (C′) and cytokines (Cyto), which are referred to as MHC class III molecules. Three principal class I molecules, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, are presented here, but this region contains information for the α chains of several other molecules, including HLA-E, HLA-F, and HLA-G. The MHC class I products complex with β2microglobulin, which is encoded by a gene on chromosome 15. The MHC class I molecules present small peptide antigens in a pocket formed by the α1 and α2 domains of the α chain. The conformation of the molecule is stabilized by β2-microglobulin (β2M) as well as by intrachain disulfide bonds (-S-S-). The α and β chains of class II molecules are also encoded in this region: HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ. In some cases, multiple genes for α and β chains are available. The MHC class II molecules present peptide antigens in a pocket formed by the α1 domain of the α chain and the β1 domain of the β chain. The genes for CD1 molecules are encoded on chromosome 1, which contains genes for five α chains (CD1A-E), and the α chains complex with β2-microglobulin to present lipid antigens in a pocket formed by the α1 and α2 domains. All three sets of antigen-presenting molecules are anchored to the plasma membrane by hydrophobic regions on the ends of the α and chains. APCs, antigen-presenting cells; Tc, T cytotoxic; Th, T-helper. Major Histocompatibility Complex MHC molecules are glycoproteins found on the surface of all human cells except red blood cells. They are divided into two general classes, class I and class II, based on their molecular structure, distribution among cell populations, and function in antigen presentation. MHC class I molecules are heterodimers composed of a large alpha (α) chain and a smaller chain called β2-microglobulin. MHC class II molecules are also heterodimers composed of α and β chains. The α and β chains of the MHC molecules are encoded from different genetic loci in a large complex of genes on the short arm of human chromosome 6 (β2microglobulin is found on chromosome 15). The MHC also contains other genes that control the quality and quantity of an immune response, which are commonly referred to as class III MHC genes. The general properties of each of the MHC classes are summarized in Fig. 8.7. The primary MHC class I genes consist of three closely linked loci labeled A, B, and C. The primary MHC class II genes are located within an area called the D region, which actually consists of three separate and independent loci: DR, DP, and DQ. MHC loci are the most genetically diverse (polymorphic) of any human genetic loci. Within the human population, the number of possible different alleles (i.e., forms of the gene) expressed by each locus is astounding: approximately 700 at the A locus, 1000 at the B locus, 350 at the C locus, 600 at the DR locus (α and β), 125 at the DQ locus (α and β), and 150 at the DP locus (α and β). These numbers are based on the polymorphism of observed DNA sequences and may not reflect differences in function. Clearly, not every allele is expressed in the same individual. Humans have two copies of each MHC locus (one inherited from each parent) that are codominant so that molecules encoded by each parent's genes are expressed on the cell surface. Within an individual, each locus will be expressing only one allele. For instance, each person will have only two different A proteins (one from each parent). Transplantation. The diversity of MHC molecules is clinically relevant during organ transplantation. Cells in transplanted tissue or organs from one individual will have a different set of MHC surface antigens than those of the recipient; therefore the recipient can mount an immune response against the foreign MHC antigens, resulting in rejection of the transplanted tissue. As a result of studies of transplantation, the human MHC molecule is also referred to as human leukocyte antigen (HLA), and the different MHC genetic loci are commonly called HLAA, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP. To minimize the chance of tissue rejection, the donor and recipient are often tissue typed beforehand to identify differences in HLA antigens. The more similar two individuals are in their HLA tissue type, the more likely a transplant from one to the other will be successful. Because of the large number of different alleles, it is highly unlikely that a perfect “match” can be found in the general population between a potential donor and the recipient. The specific combination of alleles at the six major HLA loci on one chromosome (A, B, C, DR, DQ, and DP) is termed a haplotype. Each individual has two HLA haplotypes, one from the paternal chromosome 6 and another from the maternal chromosome. Because the different HLA loci within the MHC are in such close proximity to one another, haplotypes are not usually disrupted by recombination and are thus inherited intact. One HLA haplotype from each parent is passed to each of the offspring, meaning that children usually share one haplotype with each parent (Fig. 8.8). Odds dictate that children of the same parents will share one haplotype with half of their siblings and either no haplotypes or both haplotypes with a quarter of their siblings. Thus the chance of finding a match among siblings is much higher (25%) than that from the general population. Identical twins, originating from the same egg and sperm, will have a complete set of identical genes, including HLA molecules. FIGURE 8.8 Inheritance of Human Leukocyte Antigen. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are inherited in a codominant fashion so that both maternal and paternal antigens are expressed. Specific HLA alleles are commonly given numbers to indicate different antigens. In this example, the mother has linked genes for HLA-A3 and HLA-B12 on one chromosome 6 and genes for HLA-A10 and HLA-B5 on the second chromosome 6. The father has HLA-A28 and HLA-B7 on one chromosome and HLA-A1 and HLA-B35 on the second chromosome. On one particular chromosome, the HLA antigens are firmly linked, with crossovers occurring in only 1% of individuals. The children from this pairing may have one of four possible combinations of maternal and paternal HLA. It should be noted, however, that although HLA alleles are the primary contributor to rejection of a transplant, a number of other antigens also have a role in determining tissue compatibility. Some of these are encoded on other chromosomes and are inherited independently of HLA antigens. This means that although two people have the same HLA makeup, a graft or transplant still may be rejected because of differences between other antigens. It is preferable to obtain a graft or transplant from a closely related individual, such as a sibling, because the chance of sharing both the same HLA antigens and other undetermined antigenic differences encoded outside the MHC is much greater. CD1 Another set of antigen-presenting molecules are members of the CD1 group. CD1 molecules have very low genetic polymorphism and a structure similar to that of MHC class I, and they are found primarily on APCs and cells in the thymus.5 Unlike MHC molecules that present proteins, the CD1 molecules appear to specialize in presenting lipid antigens contained in lipoproteins, glycolipids, and other molecules. These antigens are commonly important factors in infections with bacteria of the Mycobacterium spp. (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis that causes tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae that causes leprosy), which have a very large amount of lipid in their cell membranes. Molecules That Hold Cells Together The efficient development of an immune response requires several antigen-independent interactions between cells. The interactions between specific cellular receptors and their ligands result in intracellular signaling events that are independent of the TCR or BCR complexes but are necessary complements to the antigen-specific signal. Several of these molecules are listed in Box 8.1. Box 8.1 Important Adhesion Molecule Pairings Th-cell CD4 ⇔ MHC class II on APC Tc-cell CD8 ⇔ MHC class I on APC Tc-cell CD2 ⇔ CD58 (LFA-3) on APC Tc-cell CD28 ⇔ CD80 (B7-1) on APC Tc-cell LFA-1 ⇔ ICAM-1 on APC Th-cell CD40L (CD154) ⇔ CD40 on B cell Th-cell CD40L (CD154) ⇔ CD40 on APC APC, Antigen-presenting cell; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; LFA, lymphocyte function associated antigen; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Tc, T-cytotoxic; Th, T-helper. Cytokines and Their Receptors As discussed in Chapter 7, cytokines are low-molecular-weight proteins or glycoproteins that function as chemical signals between cells. A large number of cytokines are secreted by APCs and lymphocytes and provide both positive and negative regulation of the immune response. The effects of particular cytokines depend on binding to specific cellular receptors, which are linked to intracellular signaling pathways. The lymphocyte may respond in many ways. One of the most common responses is an increase in the production of proteins, many of which are other cytokines or cytokine receptors. Many cytokines also cause a lymphocyte to proliferate and differentiate. The participation of cytokines is essential to the development of an adequate immune response, and in general the precise combination of cytokines influences the ultimate response of a given cell. Specific deficiencies in the immune response that result from genetic mutations that lead to defective cytokine production or defective cytokine receptors are discussed in Chapter 9. Table 8.4 provides information about key cytokines and receptors that are known to influence the immune response.

Generation of Clonal Diversity The immune response occurs in two phases: generation of clonal diversity and clonal selection (Table 8.5 and see Fig. 8.2).6,7 During generation of clonal diversity, a large population of T cells and B cells is produced before birth. These lymphocytes have the capacity to recognize almost any foreign antigen found in the environment. This process occurs mostly in specialized lymphoid organs (the primary [central] lymphoid organs): the thymus for T cells and the bone marrow for B cells. The result is differentiation of lymphoid stem cells into B and T lymphocytes. Lymphoid stem cells are precursor cells formed in the liver (in the fetus) or in the bone marrow (of a child or adult) that do not have antigen-specific receptors (BCR and TCR) or other B-cell–specific and T-cell–specific surface proteins. After maturation in the central lymphoid organs, these stem cells develop into immunocompetent cells with antigen-specific receptors without encountering foreign antigen. Although each B or T cell expresses receptors against a single specific antigen, the total population of immunocompetent cells may have receptors that can react with more than 108 different antigenic determinants. Thus before the individual is exposed to any foreign antigen, millions of different T- and B-cell antigen receptors must be constructed to recognize any potential antigenic determinant. Immunocompetent lymphocytes are released to the circulation and many reside in secondary (peripheral) lymphoid organs (e.g., spleen, lymph nodes, adenoids, tonsils, Peyer patches). TABLE 8.5 GENERATION OF CLONAL DIVERSITY VS. CLONAL SELECTION GENERATION OF CLONAL DIVERSITY CLONAL SELECTION Purpose? To produce large numbers of T and B lymphocytes with the maximum diversity of antigen receptors Select, expand, and differentiate clones of T and B cells against a specific antigen When does it occur? Primarily in the fetus Primarily after birth and throughout life Where does it occur? Central lymphoid organs: thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells Peripheral lymphoid organs, including lymph nodes, spleen, and other lymphoid tissues Is foreign antigen involved? No Yes; antigen determines which clones of cells will be selected What Thymic hormones, IL-7, others hormones/cytokines are involved? Many cytokines produced by Th cells and APCs Is tolerance induced? Central tolerance induced as autoreactive cells are deleted Peripheral tolerance induced as autoreactive cells are regulated Final product? Immunocompetent T and B cells that can react with antigen but have not seen antigen, and migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs Plasma cells that produce antibody, effector T cells that help (Th), kill targets (Tc), or regulate immune responses (Treg); memory B and T cells APCs, Antigen-presenting cells; IL, interleukin; Tc, T-cytotoxic; Th, T-helper; Treg, regulatory T cells. Although generation of clonal diversity primarily occurs in the fetus, it probably continues to a low degree throughout most of adult life. The endless array of possible antibodies and TCRs certainly cannot be constructed from the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that is in the nucleus of a human lymphocyte. The enormous repertoire of specificities with appropriate conservation of DNA is made possible by rearrangement of smaller regions of existing DNA during T- and B-cell development in the primary lymphoid organs. Loci in the DNA that encode parts of the variable regions of immunoglobulins and TCRs are rearranged, a process known as somatic recombination, in a unique way to generate receptors that collectively can recognize and bind to any possible antigen. B-Cell Maturation Central Lymphoid Organ Lymphoid stem cells destined to become B cells percolate through specialized regions of the bone marrow, where they are exposed to hormones and cytokines that induce proliferation and differentiation into immunocompetent B cells (Fig. 8.9).8 They interact with stromal cells through a variety of intercellular adhesion molecules (e.g., stem cell factor [a cytokine bound to the membrane of stromal cells and sometimes known as steel factor]). As the stem cell begins to mature, it progressively develops a variety of necessary surface markers, one of the earliest being the interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor. IL-7, produced by the stromal cells, is critical in driving the further differentiation and proliferation of the B cell.9 The next stage in development is formation of the B-cell receptor. FIGURE 8.9 B-Cell Development in the Bone Marrow. During the generation of clonal diversity, lymphoid stem cells enter portions of the bone marrow that serve as the central lymph organ for B-cell development. Interactions with a series of bone marrow stromal cells guide the proliferation and differentiation process through direct cell-to-cell contact and the production of cytokines and hormones by the stromal cells, but without the presence of foreign antigen. A simplified scheme for that process is presented here. The differentiation process of B cells is characterized by the upregulation of many important surface molecules (only some of which are shown) and the random development of a huge number of different B-cell receptors. The early B cell (pro–B cell) binds to a membrane-bound cytokine (stem cell factor) on the stromal cell and initiates expression of the surface molecule CD45R and begins to rearrange the DJ regions of the antibody heavy-chain gene. As the cell progresses to the pre–B-cell stage, it concludes DNA rearrangement of the heavy chain (VDJ) and begins expressing cytoplasmic mu (µ) heavy chain. The µ chain is incorporated into a pre–B-cell receptor (pBCR) using a surrogate protein in place of the light chain. The cell also up-regulates the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R), which interacts with IL-7 produced by the stromal cells to drive the remaining steps in differentiation. Some pBCRs have specificities toward self-antigen. Many of these encounter self-antigen expressed on the stromal cells and undergo negative selection (clonal deletion). The surviving cells (immature B cells) rearrange the light-chain DNA (VJ) and express a BCR consisting of light chain and the µ heavy chain (membrane-bound IgM [mIgM]). In the mature B cell, changes in processing of the heavy-chain precursor RNA result in coexpression of mIgM and mIgD (see Fig. 8.11 for more details). Production of the B-Cell Receptor (BCR) The BCR is a complex of antibody that is anchored to the plasma membrane and other molecules involved in intracellular signaling. Its role is to recognize an antigen and communicate that information to the cell nucleus. BCRs on immunocompetent B cells are membraneassociated IgM (mIgM) with or without concurrent mIgD that have identical specificities for antigen. The enormous repertoire of specificities is related to the sum of diversities of CDRs in the heavy and light chain variable regions. The CDRs are encoded by multiple sets of genes that undergo somatic recombination. The process of recombination is simplest for the antibody light chains (Fig. 8.10). The segments of DNA that encode either kappa (κ) (chromosome 2) or lambda (λ) (chromosome 22) light chain are clustered in V, J, and C genes. Diversity is accomplished by random rearrangement of V and J gene regions encoding the V region. The V genes encode the first two CDRs and intervening FR regions of the V region. The J genes (joining genes) encode the third CDR (CDR3) and FR4. To create the V region of the light chain, one V gene and one J gene are randomly selected and rearranged so that the V and J are moved to adjacent positions, and the intervening DNA is excised and spliced, resulting in a VJ region that encodes the V region of the light chain. Somatic recombination is controlled by enzymes encoded by recombination activating genes (RAG-1, RAG-2) that cut and remove intervening DNA between the selected V and J gene regions and splice the VJ together.10 FIGURE 8.10 DNA Rearrangement of Genes for Antigen-Binding Molecules. During the generation of clonal diversity, a tremendous number of different antigen-binding molecules are produced. These include the Bcell receptor (BCR), which consists of a membrane-bound antibody molecule, and the T-cell receptor (TCR). The process by which receptor diversity is created is identical for all antigen-binding molecules and is summarized in this figure. Maximum diversity with minimum use of DNA is accomplished by random rearrangement of sets of genes that encode different portions of the variable regions. A, The variable regions of the light chain of antibody and the α chain of the TCR independently rearrange two sets of genes: V region genes and J region genes. The light chain uses its own set of genes, and the α chain uses a completely different set. In either case is the exact number of V or J region genes known; therefore in this figure they are numbered from 1 to an unknown value (n). In a particular cell's DNA, one V gene is randomly selected and moved to a position immediately adjacent to a randomly selected J gene. In this example, V3 and J3 were selected. The DNA between the selected genes is enzymatically removed and the DNA repaired, so that the rearranged DNA in this example is missing the portion found in the germline DNA between V3 and J3. This product is transcribed into a precursor ribonucleic acid (RNA) that contains information for the rearranged VJ pair, a span containing other unselected J regions, and information for the appropriate constant region (C gene) of the molecule. The RNA between the VJ and the C regions is not translated; therefore it is removed by RNA processing to produce a messenger RNA (mRNA) that is translated. B, The variable region of the antibody heavy chain and the TCR β chain result from a similar DNA rearrangement, with the added diversity contributed by a group of D region genes. The joining of D and J occurs first, with the removal of intervening DNA. In this example, D3 and J4 were chosen. This is followed by rearrangement of the V gene (e.g., V4) and formation of a VDJ region in the rearranged DNA. The precursor RNA contains information for the VDJ, the intervening portion of DNA, and the appropriate constant region. After RNA processing, an mRNA is formed for the intact antibody heavy chain or the TCR β chain. Once the DNA is rearranged and spliced in a given B or T cell, all of the antigen receptors produced by that cell employ the same V, D, and J segments and have the same specificity. Some V gene regions are defective; however, estimates of functional gene regions range from 40 to 70. About 5 J gene regions appear to be available. Thus recombination of a light chain may result in as many as 350 VJ possible recombinants. Within a particular differentiating B cell, a precise order of light chain rearrangement exists so that a successful VJ rearrangement prevents any attempts to any rearrangement of light chain genes on other chromosomes, and each B cell only produces one light chain. The primary mRNA transcript contains information for the VJ region, an intervening intron, and the C region gene. Processing of the mRNA (RNA splicing) removes the intron, resulting in a mRNA with contiguous VJC regions that is transcribed into an intact light chain. The gene for the heavy chain on chromosome 14 undergoes similar somatic recombination. Unlike the light chain organization of V, J, and C gene regions, the heavy chain loci consist of approximately 50 V, 30 D, and 6 J gene regions and 9 C regions, with the gene for the mu (µ) constant region being closest to the VDJ region, and the delta (δ) constant region gene being next in sequence (see Fig. 8.10). Somatic rearrangement of the V region genes is a two-step process with rearrangement to a contiguous DJ followed by formation of VDJ. During both rearrangements, intervening sequences of DNA are excised and repaired. The V gene region encodes the CDR1 and CDR2 regions and intervening FR regions. The genetic information for the CDR3 is a composite of a small amount of DNA from the V gene region, the entire D region, and a portion of the J gene region. Somatic recombination may result in more than 13,500 different heavy chain variable regions. The primary mRNA contains five exons: VDJ, µ constant region (Cµ), a µ transmembrane region (TMµ), δ constant region (Cδ), and a TMµ region (Fig. 8.11). There are no stop signals between the Cµ and Cδ so that both will be transcribed in the same mRNA.11 A stop signal is present after the information for Cδ so that other constant regions will not be transcribed. During RNA splicing all introns will be excised and all mRNA molecules will retain the same VDJ region. All cells will produce a population of mRNA containing the Cµ and its TM region. Through alternative splicing, many cells also will produce concurrently a second group of mRNA containing the Cδ and its TM region. Within a single developing immunocompetent B cell, alternatively spliced mRNA may be translated into µ and δ heavy chains that have identical V regions and have TM regions for anchoring to the cell membrane. The light chains are assembled with two µ chains to form monomeric IgM or with two δ chains to form IgD antibody. Initially, the developing B cell rearranges and expresses heavy chain that is followed by the rearrangement of either the κ or the λ light chain so that only one type is produced. The hydrophobic TM regions will result in insertion into the plasma membrane and simultaneous expression of mIgM and mIgD with identical CDRs and antigen specificities. A very rough calculation of the diversity resulting from this process would be the diversity of the H chain (13,500) × the diversity of the κ light chain (350) + the H chain diversity (13,500) × the λ light chain (350) = 9.45 × 106 combinations of H and L chain CDRs. FIGURE 8.11 Coexpression of IgM and IgD B-Cell Receptors. Most mature immunocompetent B cells express both membrane-bound IgM and IgD as the B-cell receptor. In the germline DNA, the heavy-chain gene complex consists of a series of V, D, J, and constant region genes. In humans, each class and subclass of antibody has a unique constant region gene arranged in the indicated order. Switch regions occur preceding every constant region gene, except mu (µ) (IgM) and delta (δ) (IgD). After successful DNA rearrangement of the VDJ regions, a ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule is transcribed that contains the information from the VDJ, intervening DNA, the µ constant region, and the δ constant region. Precursor RNA molecules are alternatively processed to produce messenger RNAs (mRNAs) containing either µ or δ. Initially, RNA processing favors the µ chain and production of membrane-bound IgM (see Fig. 8.10), but as the B cell matures, both mRNA molecules are produced. IgD, immunoglobulin D; IgM, immunoglobulin M. The BCR signaling complex is further constructed by the addition of two Igα and Igβ heterodimers that are closely associated with the BCR and contain tyrosine kinase signaling activity. The antibody portion of the BCR complex is responsible for recognition and binding to an antigen but, by itself, cannot provide the intracellular signals required to activate the B cell and complete its later maturation into plasma cells. That message is conveyed by the Igα and Igβ heterodimers. Changes in Characteristic Surface Markers B-cell differentiation is also characterized by the development of a variety of important surface molecules. These include CD21 (a complement receptor) and CD40 (adhesion molecule required for later interactions with Th cells). Central Tolerance Because assembly of the VJ and VDJ regions is random, B-cell receptors will be produced that react with self-antigens (autoreactive B cells). Further development and release of these autoreactive cells into the circulation would result in a catastrophic immune attack against the individual's own tissues. One stage at which immune tolerance (suppression or limitation of immune responses against self-antigens) occurs is the deletion of autoreactive B cells in the bone marrow, which is referred to as central tolerance (induction of tolerance within the central lymphoid organs). During the very earliest stages of formation of the BCR in the bone marrow, a large number of autoreactive B cells undergo apoptosis (clonal deletion) if exposed to self-antigen. This process of negative selection induces the death of more than 90% of developing B cells. Some autoreactive clones persist and must be controlled by other means in the lymphoid organs (peripheral tolerance). T-Cell Maturation Central Lymphoid Organ The process of T-cell generation of clonal diversity is similar to that for B cells. The primary lymphoid organ for T-cell development is the thymus, which is an organ located near the heart. Lymphoid stem cells migrate to the thymus and enter the subcapsular region. As the cells journey through the thymic cortex to the medulla, they are instructed by interactions with various thymic cells (epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells), thymic hormones (e.g., thymosin, thymopoietin, thymostimulin, and others produced by the thymic epithelium), and the cytokine IL-7 to undergo proliferation and progressive development of the characteristics of immunocompetent T cells (Fig. 8.12). Changes include development of the T-cell receptor complex and expression of characteristic surface molecules. The final immunocompetent T cells are released into the blood vessels and lymphatic vessels to establish residence in the secondary lymphoid organs to await antigen. FIGURE 8.12 T-Cell Development in the Thymus. During the generation of clonal diversity in the fetus, lymphoid stem cells undergo several stages of cellular division and differentiation in a central lymphoid organ (the thymus) under the control of hormones but without the influence of foreign antigen. A simplified scheme for that process is presented here. The differentiation process is characterized by the upregulation of many important surface molecules (only some of which are shown) and the random development of a huge number of different T-cell receptors against all possible antigens that the adult may encounter. The lymphoid stem cell enters the subcapsular region of the thymus, where it begins to undergo differentiation. One of the first surface changes is the appearance of the molecule CD2, which is a marker for all T cells. In the cortex of the thymus, the developing cell encounters epithelial cells that guide most of the early differentiation process. The pre–T cell begins expressing the surface receptor for the cytokine IL-7, which is produced by the epithelial cell along with other thymic hormones to drive the T-cell differentiation process. At this stage the T cell begins constructing the T-cell receptor (TCR) by first rearranging and expressing the TCR β chain (more detail is provided in Fig. 8.10) and expressing CD3 molecules. Although the TCR α chain has not yet been produced, the β chain is expressed on the surface as a pre-TCR (pTCR) using a protein that acts as a surrogate for the α chain. Because of the randomness of the process, some pTCRs are produced with specificities toward self-antigens. Many of these undergo negative selection and are deleted (clonal deletion) by apoptosis induced through interactions with self-antigens presented by the epithelial cells. Survivors of negative selection move toward the thymic cortex and begin expressing the TCR α chain, the normal TCR, and both CD4 and CD8 on their surfaces. These CD4+, CD8+ “double-positive” cells encounter medullary epithelial cells that express both MHC class I and MHC class II molecules. The phenotype of the developing T cell is positively selected so that interaction between CD4 and MHC class II selects for retention of CD4 expression, whereas interaction between CD8 and MHC class I favors the CD8 phenotype. Thus two populations of “single-positive” immunocompetent T cells leave the thymus: one cell is CD4+, CD8− (destined to be a helper T [Th] cell) and the other is CD4−, CD8+ (destined to be a cytotoxic T [Tc] cell). Production of the T-Cell Receptor Within the thymic cortex, the cells begin rearranging the variable region genes necessary for forming a functional T-cell receptor. The basic process of TCR rearrangement is essentially identical with formation of the BCR and, although the structure of the TCR closely resembles a Fab portion of antibody, the TCR uses different genes than are used for antibody (see Fig. 8.5). The most common TCR contains α and β chains, each of which has a variable region and a constant region. The variable regions of the TCR α and β chains also undergo somatic recombination: the α chain gene (chromosome 14) rearranges V and J regions and the β chain gene (chromosome 7) rearranges V, D, and J regions. Somatic recombination of the α chain proceeds as described for the antibody light chain using a set of at least 70 V region genes and at least 50 J region genes (see Fig. 8.10). Thus potentially 3500 different α chains may be generated. Rearrangement of the β chain occurs similarly as described for antibody heavy chain rearrangement. A major difference, however, is the option of using two separate C gene regions (Cβ1 and Cβ2) each of which is adjacent to its own set of D and J gene regions. Somatic rearrangement of the β chain gene segments uses at least 60 V gene regions and 2 Cβ regions (each containing at least 1 D and 6 or 7 J gene regions). As many as 720 different β chains may be produced. As with the generation of antibody diversity, the primary mRNA for α and β chains contains V region and C region exons with an intervening intron that is removed by RNA processing. Assembly of the α and β chains results in TCR diversity that potentially represents 2.5 × 106 (3500 α chains × 720 β chains) antigenic specificities. For both α and β chains, the V region genes encode the amino acid sequences that include CDR1 and CDR2 and their appropriate FR regions. The J regions contain information for CDR3 and FR4. The TCR β chain D regions encode a short amino acid sequence found in the CDR3 and greatly increase the diversity of the β chain CDR3. As with somatic rearrangement of antibody light and heavy gene regions, the level of diversity, especially for the CDR3 regions, may be increased further by other factors. Imprecise joining increases the diversity of the CDR3 regions. For example, the sites of VJ and VDJ joining may shift slightly, resulting in an amino acid being inserted or deleted from the protein. Although the αβ TCR is the preferred antigen receptor, some T cells (about 5% of the total T-cell population) use alternative genes: gamma (γ) (chromosome 7) and delta (δ) (chromosome 14, in the middle of α chain genes). T cells with γδ TCRs appear to migrate to unique areas of the body (the epithelial areas in the skin, reproductive tract, intestine, respiratory tract) and have different and less well understood functions than the T cells with αβ TCRs. A functional TCR requires intracellular signaling molecules. Insertion of the TCR into the plasma membrane is associated with expression and association with TCR accessory molecules (collectively called CD3) that provide signaling to the nucleus after the binding of antigen to the TCR. CD3 is a marker for T cells that successfully form a TCR complex and are immunocompetent. Changes in Characteristic Surface Markers Differentiation of T cells in the thymus also results in changes in a variety of important surface molecules. Much of T-cell development is controlled by hormones and cytokines in the thymus, and an early step in maturation is expression of the receptor for interleukin-7 (IL7R), which is a major cytokine that drives the differentiation process.12 Transit through the thymic cortex initiates expression of the molecule CD2 on the cell surface. CD2 is expressed on virtually every subpopulation of cells that have undergone development in the thymus and is thus a T-cell marker. The developing T cell also begins making two other important surface proteins, CD4 and CD8, which are concurrently expressed on the developing cell's surface at this stage.13 CD4+, CD8+ cells are often called “double-positive” cells. After entering the medulla of the thymus, the double-positive cells become “single-positive.” That is, some of the cells suppress production of the CD8 molecule and remain only CD4+, whereas others suppress CD4 production and remain CD8+. The phenotypic change to single-positive cells is driven by exposure of CD4+, CD8+ cells to MHC antigen expressed on cells of thymus. The CD4 and CD8 molecules react specifically with MHC class II molecules or MHC class I molecules, respectively. For instance, if a double-positive cell initially comes into contact with MHC class II molecules on the thymic cells, the T cell will suppress expression of CD8 and become CD4 single-positive. However, if initial reactivity occurs between the CD8 and MHC class I molecules, the cells will become CD8 single-positive. Thus this positive selection process results in two groups of immunocompetent cells with different functional characteristics: CD4 cells develop into T-helper cells (Th cells) in the clonal selection process, whereas CD8 cells become mediators of cellmediated immunity and kill other cells directly (e.g., Tc cells). Approximately 60% of immunocompetent T cells in the circulation express CD4 and 40% express CD8. Central Tolerance During the random rearrangement of VJ and VDJ genes to produce the T-cell receptor, some combinations result in specificities that recognize self-antigens. If some of these autoreactive T cells were allowed to progress further in development and leave the thymus, a severe immunologic reaction against the individual's own tissues could result. One stage at which tolerance for self-antigens is maintained is the deletion of autoreactive T cells in the thymus, which is referred to as central tolerance. A large spectrum of self-antigens is expressed on the surface of thymic macrophages, dendritic cells, and especially epithelial cells.14 If a developing T-cell's TCR binds strongly with a self-antigen, it will undergo apoptosis (clonal deletion). Although this process of negative selection induces more than 95% of T cells to undergo apoptosis in the thymus, a limited number of autoreactive clones persist and must be controlled by other means in the peripheral lymphoid organs (peripheral tolerance, discussed in the section titled Antigens and Immunogens). Induction of an Immune Response: Clonal Selection Antigens initiate the second phase of the immune response, clonal selection. The process proceeds through three finely tuned sets of intercellular collaborations that result in the production of effector cells (Th cells, plasma cells, Tc cells) and memory cells that provide long-term specific protection against infectious microorganisms. Step 1 is antigen processing and presentation. This is the “selection” component of clonal selection in that the particular antigen is selective for maturing those B and T cells with related TCR and BCR specificities. Step 2 is induction of a population of Th cells. Immunocompetent CD4+ T cells respond to presented antigen and proliferate and differentiate into populations of effector Th cells (e.g., Th1, Th2, Th17 cells). Step 3 is induction of immunocompetent B cells into plasma cells and immunocompetent CD8+ T cells into Tc cells. This step requires the presence of antigen presentation and effector Th cells. Steps 2 and 3 are dependent on highly regulated interactions among cells: APCs and immunocompetent Th cells in step 2 and APCs, effector Th cells, and immunocompetent B or CD8+ T cells in step 3. Successful intercellular collaborations depend on three complementary signaling events: antigen-specific recognition through the TCR complex, intercellular adhesion between specific cell surface receptors/ligands, and secretion of and response to specific groups of cytokines. Without all of these signaling events, a protective immune response would not be produced. Clonal selection usually begins at birth and proceeds throughout the life of the individual as new antigens are encountered, although it can begin as early as the eighth week of gestation in humans if foreign antigens are encountered in utero. Most commonly, foreign antigens encountered in utero are related to fetal infection during the last third of gestation. Secondary Lymphoid Organs Most aspects of clonal selection begin in the secondary lymphoid organs: the spleen, lymph nodes, adenoids, tonsils, Peyer patches (intestines), and the appendix (see Fig. 8.3). Immunocompetent lymphocytes enter the secondary lymphoid organs through the blood and enter specialized small veins, called high endothelial venules (HEVs), where they bind to the endothelium through a family of adhesion molecules. The lymphocytes migrate from the vessels into the lymphoid tissues, which contain B- and T-cell–rich areas. B lymphocytes that encounter antigen in the secondary lymph organs usually undergo a process of differentiation and proliferation that results in the formation of specialized germinal centers in these organs (Fig. 8.13).15 FIGURE 8.13 Histology of a Secondary Lymphoid Organ. A, The lymph node contains areas (primary follicles) that are rich in immunocompetent B cells (stained green), and T cells (stained red) in the paracortex. B, A lymph node is organized into an outer cortex and an inner medulla. C, In response to antigen, B cells undergo proliferation, resulting in the formation of secondary follicles with germinal centers. (Modified from Kumar V, Abbas A, Fausto N: Robbins & Cotran pathologic basis of disease, ed 8, Philadelphia, 2010, Saunders.) Antigen Processing and Presentation Most antigens do not react directly with T or B cells, but require processing and presentation in the appropriate fashion. This is the duty of APCs. Most cells have the capacity to present antigen to some degree, but dendritic cells, macrophages, and B lymphocytes are so efficient at antigen presentation that they are considered “professional” APCs. Each is responsible for the presentation of antigens of different types and from different sources. B cells can process soluble antigens and present them to Th cells that facilitate development of the humoral immune response. Macrophages are effective APCs for the development of immune responses against antigenic components of infectious agents (e.g., bacteria). Contamination of tissue by infectious microbes usually initiates an inflammatory response and the infiltration of macrophages into the site. Macrophages also are very effective in presenting antigen to memory Th cells in order to initiate a rapid response to antigens that have been previously encountered by the immune system. The dendritic cells are perhaps the most effective in presenting antigen to naïve immunocompetent Th cells.16 Dendritic cells develop from bone marrow precursor cells, either of myeloid or of lymphoid lineage (at least two populations of dendritic cells have been described). They migrate to the peripheral tissues (e.g., skin, intestinal tract) and to the secondary lymphoid organs. Immature dendritic cells at a site of inflammation function as phagocytes, and the process of phagocytosis can initiate differentiation and directed migration of dendritic cells to the secondary lymphoid organs, particularly the lymph nodes (Fig. 8.14). Thus dendritic cells can carry processed antigen from a site of inflammation to the T-cell–rich areas of the lymph nodes. FIGURE 8.14 The Role of the Dendritic Cell in Capturing Antigen. Immature dendritic cells in the tissues encounter and phagocytose antigen, which results in the production of inflammatory cytokines and a loss of adhesive interactions with neighboring cells. The maturing dendritic cell migrates through the lymphatic vessels to a regional lymph node, where it presents the antigen to immunocompetent T cells to initiate the clonal selection process. (Redrawn from Kumar V, Abbas A, Fausto N: Robbins & Cotran pathologic basis of disease, ed 8, Philadelphia, 2010, Saunders.) Additionally, infectious microbes or fragments of the microbe may be drained by lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are extremely rich in dendritic cells and macrophages. Pathogens entering the bloodstream may be removed by phagocytic cells in the spleen and other lymphoid tissues. In either case, the phagocytic cells that engulf foreign microbes or their fragments are also responsible for processing antigens from the pathogen and displaying or presenting those antigens on the phagocyte's surface to neighboring lymphocytes in order to initiate the adaptive immune response against that specific pathogen. Pathways of Antigen Processing and Presentation In general, the immune system responds to two types of antigens: exogenous and endogenous. Using infection as a model, exogenous antigens are carried on microorganisms that are trapped and killed by phagocytic cells; therefore they come from outside the cell. Endogenous antigens are synthesized within a cell. These include viral antigens because viruses infect cells and use the normal cellular proteinsynthesizing machinery to translate the viral genes into viral proteins. Endogenous antigens also may include those uniquely produced by cancerous cells. When many cells undergo malignant change, they begin producing unique proteins that are specific to cancer cells and are presented as foreign antigens on the cell surface. Exogenous and endogenous antigens are preferentially presented by different classes of MHC molecules: class I MHC molecules generally present endogenous antigens, and class II molecules prefer exogenous antigens (Fig. 8.15). Because class I MHC molecules are expressed on all cells, except red blood cells, any change in that cell attributable to viral infection or malignancy may result in foreign antigen being presented by MHC class I. Class II MHC molecules are coexpressed with MHC class I molecules on a more limited number of cells that have APC function, including macrophages, dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes, and some endothelial cells. FIGURE 8.15 Antigen Processing and Presentation. Antigen processing and presentation are required for initiation of most immune responses. Foreign antigen may be either endogenous (cytosolic protein) or exogenous (e.g., bacterium). Endogenous antigenic determinants (antigenic peptides) are produced by cellular proteasomes and transported by transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and CD1 molecules are being assembled. In the ER, antigenic peptides bind to the α chains of the MHC class I molecule, and the complex is transported to the cell surface. In the ER, the α and β chains of the MHC class II molecules are also being assembled, but the antigen-binding site is blocked by a small molecule (invariant chain) to prevent interactions with endogenous antigenic peptides. The MHC class II–invariant chain complex is transported to lysosomes, where exogenous antigenic fragments have been generated as a result of phagocytosis. In the lysosomes, the invariant chain is digested and replaced by exogenous antigenic peptides, after which the MHC class II–antigen complex is inserted into the cell membrane. CD1 is also assembled in the ER, but its antigen-binding site is specific for lipid antigenic determinants and does not bind endogenous antigenic peptides. The CD1 molecule is transported to the lysosomes and may encounter and bind antigenic lipids produced by phagocytic digestion of engulfed bacteria. The CD1-antigen complex is transported to the cell membrane and presents lipid antigens. Thus the term antigen processing relates to the process by which exogenous and endogenous antigens are linked with the appropriate MHC molecules. Endogenous antigens are usually components of proteins synthesized in the cytosol.17 They are degraded into small peptides in the cytosol by proteasomes and transported by TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) proteins (TAP-1 and TAP-2) into the endoplasmic reticulum, where MHC class I and class II molecules are assembled.18 The class I MHC molecules have open antigen-binding sites so that antigen, the class I MHC α chain, and a β2-microglobulin molecule form a stable complex that is transported through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The antigenic peptides presented by class I MHC molecules are usually very small, 8 to 10 amino acids in length. MHC class II molecules are also assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum but do not bind with endogenous antigen because the antigen-binding site is blocked by a small protein called invariant chain.19 Exogenous antigens are internalized by phagocytosis and small antigenic molecules produced by digestion in the lysosomes. The MHC class II complexes of the class II α and β chains, with invariant chain, are transported to the lysosomes where the invariant chain is digested and replaced by antigenic molecules that are usually slightly larger (in excess of 12 amino acids in length) than those presented by MHC class I molecules.20 CD1 is a third antigen-presenting molecule that presents a variety of lipid-containing antigens that are usually derived from phagocytosis and digestion of infectious microorganisms with very high lipid content in their cell membranes. Therefore CD1 complexes with antigen in the lysosomes, in a fashion similar to MHC class II. The “pocket” that holds antigen for presentation by CD1 is generally more narrow and deeper than that described for MHC molecules, and it is lined with many hydrophobic amino acids that interact with lipid. T-Helper Lymphocytes Formation of a robust immune response depends on generation of a spectrum of highly specialized effector cells, Th cells. A group of immunocompetent CD4+ cells (Th precursor cells) responds to antigen presentation by undergoing proliferation and maturation into a phenotypically diverse population of cells that will (1) help immunocompetent CD8+ T cells differentiate into Tc cells and Tmemory cells (Th1 cells), (2) help immunocompetent B cells differentiate into plasma cells and B-memory cells (Th2 cells), (3) increase the capacity of phagocytes to defend against infection with chronic microorganisms that are relatively resistant to normal levels of inflammation (e.g., organisms that cause tuberculosis or leprosy) (Th17 cells), and (4) limit the immune response to control excessive damage to normal tissue (Treg cells). These subpopulations of Th cells are critical to most immune responses, and a variety of major Th-cell defects that lead to severely diminished immune responses are discussed in Chapter 9. APC-Th Cooperation Cells that are destined to become Th cells emerge from the thymus with characteristic cell surface markers. They have a functional αβ TCR complex and express the surface molecule CD4 and lack CD8. These are generally referred to as precursor Th cells, or sometimes Thp cells (Fig. 8.16). Three critical and concurrent signals between APCs and Thp cells are necessary to initiate the Th-cell differentiation process. The first is an antigen-specific signal. The APC presents antigen held by the polymorphic regions (α1 and β1) of the α and β chains of MHC class II molecules.20 The antigen also binds to the TCR complex on the Th cell. The strength of the intercellular antigen binding is increased by CD4 on the Th cell, which binds to a nonpolymorphic (a region of amino acids shared by all MHC class II molecules) sequence of the β2 region of the MHC class II molecule. As a result of collaborative binding of the TCR to the MHC class II/antigen complex, the cytoplasmic portions of CD3 (the TCR signaling complex) and the CD4 molecule interact and initiate a series of enzymatic interactions that send a signal to the nucleus. FIGURE 8.16 Development of T-Cell Subsets. The most important step in clonal selection is the production of populations of T helper (Th) cells (Th1, Th2, and Th17) and regulatory T (Treg) cells that are necessary for the development of cellular and humoral immune responses. In this model, APCs (probably multiple populations) may influence whether a precursor Th cell (Thp cell) will differentiate into a Th1, Th2, Th17, or Treg cell. Differentiation of the Thp cell is initiated by three signaling events. (1) The antigen signal is produced by the interaction of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD4 with antigen presented by MHC class II molecules. A set of costimulatory signals is produced from interactions between adhesion molecules (e.g., CD80 and CD28) (not shown). A third signal is produced by the interactions of cytokines (particularly interleukin-1 [IL-1]) with appropriate cytokine receptors (IL-1R) on the Thp cell. (2) The Thp cell upregulates IL-2 production and expression of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), which act in an autocrine fashion to accelerate Thp-cell differentiation and proliferation. (3) Commitment to a particular phenotype results from the relative concentrations of other cytokines. IL-12 and IFN-γ produced by some populations of APCs favor differentiation into the Th1-cell phenotype; IL-4, which is produced by a variety of cells, favors differentiation into the Th2-cell phenotype; IL-6 and TGF-β (T-cell growth factor) facilitate differentiation into Th17 cells; IL-2 and TGF-β induce differentiation into Treg cells. The Th1 cell is characterized by the production of cytokines that assist in the differentiation of cytotoxic T (Tc) cells, leading to cellular immunity, whereas the Th2 cell produces cytokines that favor B-cell differentiation and humoral immunity. Th1 and Th2 cells affect each other through the production of inhibitory cytokines: IFN-γ will inhibit the development of Th2 cells, and IL-4 will inhibit the development of Th1 cells. Th17 cells produce cytokines that affect phagocytes and increase inflammation. Treg cells produce immunosuppressive cytokines that prevent the immune response from being excessive. APC, Antigen-presenting cell; IFN, interferon; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TGF, transforming growth factor; TNF-β, tumor necrosis factor-beta. A second costimulatory signal results from the interactions of a variety of adhesion molecules. The antigenic signal alone is inadequate and may even inactivate the Th cell if costimulatory signals are not present.21 The most critical interaction is between B7 on the APC and CD28 on the Th cell, which activates the enzymatic activity of the cytoplasmic portion of CD28 and initiation of additional intracellular signaling pathways. The third signal occurs through Th-cell cytokine receptors. In the early stages of Th-cell differentiation, IL-1 secreted by the APC provides this signal through the IL-1 receptor on the Th cell (see Fig. 8.16). Initially, the Th cell responds by producing the cytokine IL-2 and upregulation of IL-2 receptors. IL-2 is secreted and acts in an autocrine (self-stimulating) fashion to induce further maturation and proliferation of the Th cell. Without IL-2 production, the Th cell cannot efficiently mature into a functional helper cell. Th Subsets At this point and depending on the predominant cytokines in the immediate environment, Th cells undergo differentiation into one of several subsets: Th1, Th2, Th17, or Treg cells. These subsets have different primary functions: Th1 cells preferentially provide help in developing Tc cells (cell-mediated immunity), Th2 cells provide help for developing B cells (humoral immunity), Th17 cells are cytokinesecreting cells that activate macrophages, and Treg cells limit the immune response (these functions are discussed in the sections on cellular interactions). The Th subsets are cytokine-secreting (lymphokine-secreting) T cells but differ considerably in the spectrum of molecules they produce, their cytokine receptors, and intercellular adhesion molecules. Th1 cells produce IL-2, tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-β), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ);22 Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13,23 and Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22.24 Th1 and Th2 cells have different cytokine receptors and may suppress each other (Th1 cell IFN-γ will inhibit development of Th2 cells and Th2 cell IL-4 will inhibit development of Th1 cells) so that the immune response may favor either antibody formation with suppression of a cell-mediated response, or the opposite.25 For example, antigens derived from viral or bacterial pathogens and those derived from cancer cells seem to induce a greater number of Th1 cells relative to Th2 cells, whereas antigens derived from multicellular parasites and allergens may result in production of more Th2 cells. Many antigens (e.g., tetanus vaccine), however, will produce excellent humoral- and cell-mediated responses simultaneously. How a Th cell is guided into becoming a Th1, Th2, or Th17 cell is not fully known. Some evidence indicates that different subpopulations of APCs influence the choice by secreting different profiles of cytokines that may favor one route of differentiation over another (see Fig. 8.16). B-Cell Clonal Selection: The Humoral Immune Response When an immunocompetent B cell encounters an antigen for the first time, only those cells with specific BCRs complementary to that antigen's determinant sites are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate (clonal selection), resulting in multiple copies of that particular B cell. The differentiated B cell becomes a plasma cell and can be found in the blood, secondary lymphoid organs (primarily spleen and lymph nodes), and some inflammatory sites. Each plasma cell is a factory for antibody production and is dedicated to the secretion of a single class or subclass of antibody with one variable region and therefore specificity against one antigenic determinant. Primary and Secondary Immune Responses The immune response to antigenic challenge has classically been divided into two phases—the primary and secondary responses. These phases occur for development of both humoral and cellular immunity but can be most easily demonstrated by serologic tests that measure plasma concentrations of antibody over time (Fig. 8.17). On initial or primary exposure to most antigens, there is a latent period, or lag phase. After approximately 5 to 7 days, IgM antibody specific for that antigen can be detected in the circulation followed by the production of IgG against the same antigen. The quantity of IgG produced may be about equal to or less than the amount of IgM production. The amount of antibody in a serum sample is frequently referred to as the titer; a higher titer indicates more antibodies. This is the primary immune response. The lag phase is a result of the time necessary for clonal selection, including processing and presentation of antigens, induction of Th cells, interactions between immunocompetent B cells and Th cells, and maturation and proliferation of the B cells into plasma cells and memory cells. If no further exposure to the antigen occurs, the circulating antibody is catabolized (broken down) and measurable quantities fall. The individual's immune system, however, has been primed. FIGURE 8.17 Primary and Secondary Immune Responses. Antigen responses are dominated by two classes of immunoglobulins, IgM and IgG. IgM predominates on initial exposure to the antigen in the primary response, with IgG appearing later. After the host's immune system is primed, another challenge by the same antigen induces the secondary response in which some IgM and larger amounts of IgG are produced. A second challenge by the same antigen results in the secondary (anamnestic) immune response, which is characterized by a very rapid production of a larger amount of antibody than that produced by the primary response. The rapidity of the secondary immune response is the result of the presence of memory cells that require little further differentiation into plasma cells. IgM may be transiently produced in the secondary response, and the quantity may be about the same as that produced in the primary response. IgG production is increased considerably, making it the predominant antibody class of the secondary response. It is often present in concentrations severalfold larger than those of IgM, and levels of circulating IgG specific for that antigen may remain elevated for an extended period of time. Natural infection (e.g., the virus rubella) may result in measurable levels of protective IgG for the life of the individual. Some vaccines (e.g., polio) also may produce extremely long-lived protection, although most vaccines require boosters at specified intervals. The existence of a prolonged and protective secondary immune response explains how vaccinations provide protection against certain pathogenic microorganisms. Edward Jenner, an English physician of the late eighteenth century, performed the first well-documented vaccine trial.26,27 Although some of the stories about Jenner's experiments are fanciful, it is known that Jenner recognized that milkmaids were protected from the deadly smallpox virus if they had previously developed cowpox, a bovine equivalent of smallpox that causes only mild disease in humans. Jenner took material from a cowpox pustule on the hand of an infected milkmaid and injected it into the arm of an 8-year-old boy. After the boy's initial inflammatory reaction to the injection subsided, Jenner injected the boy again, this time with material from a smallpox pustule. Fortunately, the experiment was a success because Jenner is reported to have injected smallpox virus into the boy at least 20 times without the child becoming ill. In Jenner's experiment, the antigens on the cowpox virus and the smallpox virus were sufficiently similar that the cowpox antigen functioned as an altered or attenuated smallpox antigen. The antibodies and lymphocytes that recognized and destroyed cowpox also were able to recognize the smallpox virus, thereby protecting the immunized child against smallpox. In 1798, Jenner used the term vaccination (vacca = cow) to describe his technique. Cellular Interactions A further sequence of cellular interactions is required to produce an effective antibody response (Fig. 8.18). The immunocompetent B cell is also an APC and expresses surface mIgM and mIgD BCRs. Unlike the T-cell receptor that can only “see” processed and presented antigen, the BCR can react with soluble antigen that has not been processed.28 B cells also express surface CD21, which is a receptor for opsonins produced by the complement system. Circulating antigen released from the surface of a microbial pathogen will have activated the complement system through the alternative or lectin pathways. Thus complement receptors on the B cell, such as CD21 and CD19, act as coreceptors to bind antigen. Antigen binding through the BCR complex and CD21 activates the B cell to internalize, process, and present a complex of antigenic molecules and MHC class II molecules to neighboring Th2 cells. The Th2 cell binds to the presented antigen through its TCR and CD4. The intercellular bridge created through antigen induces the Th2 cell to up-regulate additional surface receptors and secrete cytokines. Interactions between CD40 on the Bcell surface and the CD40 ligand (CD40L, also called CD154) on the Th2 cell, as well as between B7 on the B cell and CD28 on the Th cell, provide necessary costimulatory signals. The cytokine signal is provided by Th2-cell cytokines (particularly IL-4) binding to the appropriate cytokine receptors (e.g., IL-4R) on the B cell and initiating B-cell proliferation and maturation into a plasma cell. FIGURE 8.18 B-Cell Clonal Selection. Immunocompetent B cells undergo proliferation and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Three signals are necessary. The antigen signal is provided by the B cell itself. A B cell can recognize soluble antigen directly through the B-cell receptor and co-receptors, such as complement receptors (CD21), which usually involve accessory molecules such as CD19 (not shown). Antigen is internalized and processed for presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which interact with the T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD4 on Th2 cells. Costimulatory signals are provided through adhesion molecules, particularly CD40 and CD40L (CD154). The cytokine signal is provided by Th2 cytokines (particularly interleukin [IL]-4) binding to appropriate cytokine receptors (IL-4R) on the B cell. Additional cytokines influence switch to particular classes or subclasses of antibody. Class-Switch A major component of maturation is antibody class-switch, the process that results in the change in antibody production from one class to another during the primary immune response.11 The immunocompetent B cell produces mIgM and mIgD before clonal selection. After encountering antigen, however, each B cell has the option of changing the class of antibody to a secreted form of one of the four IgG subclasses, one of the two IgA subclasses, or IgE, or continuing to produce IgM but changing to a secreted form, usually a pentamer. This process is called class- or isotype-switch. During this process the variable region of the antibody heavy chain is conserved, and the light chain remains unchanged from that used in the BCR; therefore the antigenic specificity of new classes of antibody also remains unchanged. The mechanism of class-switch involves another round of somatic recombination, during which the VDJ region encoding the heavy chain's variable region is moved to another site on the DNA that is adjacent to the gene for a different constant region. This step is under the control of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICD) (Fig. 8.19). The intervening DNA is cut and mended with removal of the DNA that was between the VDJ site and the new constant region. Specific recognition sites (switch regions) precede each constant region gene, and the particular constant region chosen for class-switch appears to be, at least partially, under the control of specific Th2 cytokines. For instance, IL-4 and IL-13 appear to preferentially stimulate switch to IgE secretion, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and IL-5 appear to play major roles in class-switch to IgA secretion.29 Thus during clonal selection a B cell may produce a population of plasma cells that are capable of producing many different classes and subclasses of antibodies against the same antigen. FIGURE 8.19 Genetics of Class-Switch. During clonal selection, most B cells switch from expression of surface IgM and IgD to a different class or subclass of antibody. A first set of DNA rearrangements during the generation of clonal diversity resulted in formation of the VDJ region. The class-switch process involves a second DNA rearrangement during which the VDJ region is moved to a switch region (orange ovals) immediately preceding the new class/subclass of antibody. In this example, the B cell undergoes class-switch to a γ1 heavy chain and secretion of an IgG1 antibody. The intervening DNA between the VDJ and the selected switch region is excised, and the DNA is repaired (DNA after second rearrangement) and transcribed into a precursor ribonucleic acid (RNA). The RNA is processed to a messenger RNA (mRNA) with information for the new heavy chain. A few antigens can bypass the need for Th cells and can directly stimulate B-cell maturation and proliferation. These are called T cell– independent antigens (Fig. 8.20). They are mostly bacterial products that are large and are likely to have repeating antigenic determinants (multiple identical antigenic determinant sites) that bind and crosslink several B-cell receptors. The accumulated intracellular signal is adequate to induce differentiation to a plasma cell but is not adequate to induce class-switch. The CD40-CD40L interaction is a necessary component of the signal that leads to class-switch. T cell–independent antigens usually induce a relatively pure IgM primary and secondary immune response. FIGURE 8.20 Activation of a B Cell by a T-Cell–Independent Antigen. Molecules containing repeating identical antigenic determinants may interact simultaneously with several receptors on the surface of the B cell and induce the proliferation and production of immunoglobulins, mainly IgM. During the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, the CDR portions of the antibody variable region are prone to somatic point mutations that lead to changes in single amino acids. Some of these changes produce better antibodies that bind more strongly (higher affinity) to the antigen. The presence of antigen creates a positive selective pressure toward the developing B cells that express the higher-affinity antibody, which results in a process called affinity maturation and an improved quality of circulating antibody over time. Plasma cells may migrate to special regions of the spleen, lymph nodes, and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues that support the plasma cell's long-term survival and function so that an adequate level of protective antibody may be available in the circulation for decades after vaccination or resolution of infection. B Memory Cells During the clonal selection process, B cells differentiate into antibodyproducing plasma cells and into a set of long-lived memory cells. Memory cells remain inactive until subsequent exposure to the same antigen. Upon reexposure, these memory cells do not require much further differentiation and will therefore differentiate rapidly into new plasma cells and produce larger amounts of antibody (secondary immune response). T-Cell Activation: The Cellular Immune Response The clonal selection process produces several subsets of effector T cells (different phenotypes of Th cells have been discussed in the section on Th subsets). Clonal selection of other T-cell phenotypes is dependent on help by the Th1 cell phenotype. Other effector cells include Tc cells that attack and destroy cells expressing antigens of intracellular (endogenous) origins (virus-infected cells, cancer cells), T-regulatory cells (Treg cells) that limit (suppress) the immune response, and T-memory cells that provide a rapid cell-mediated immune reaction to repeated exposure to the same antigen (secondary immune response). Cellular Interactions During the clonal selection phase of the cell-mediated immune response, immunocompetent CD8+ T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs must recognize antigen that has been processed and presented by MHC class I molecules (Fig. 8.21). The antigen is usually an endogenous antigen expressed on the surface of cells infected with a virus or cells that have become malignant. The antigen-driven signal for Tc-cell clonal selection is recognition of the presented antigen by the TCR combined with CD8 binding to a constant region of the MHC class I molecule α chain. The presence of the CD8 molecule confines antigen recognition to MHC class I molecules; therefore CD8+ T cells are class I restricted. The co-recognition of the MHC-antigen complex by the TCR and CD8 brings the CD8 cytoplasmic region into proximity with the CD3 components of the TCR complex, which initiates a series of enzymatic interactions among other molecules associated with the cytoplasmic portions of CD3 and CD4, as was described for Th-cell activation.30 These molecules activate a signaling pathway from the TCR to the T-cell nucleus. FIGURE 8.21 Tc-Cell Clonal Selection. The development of effector Tcytotoxic (Tc) cells during clonal selection results from three cooperative signaling events provided by antigen, costimulatory adhesion molecules, and cytokines. The immunocompetent Tc cell “sees” antigen presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of a virally infected or cancerous “abnormal” cell. The antigen–MHC class I complex is recognized simultaneously by the T-cell receptor (TCR), which binds to antigen, and CD8, which binds to the MHC class I molecule. The proximity of signaling molecules associated with the cytoplasmic portions of CD8 and the TCR results in intracellular signaling. A separate signal results from the interaction of several groups of adhesion molecules (e.g., CD80 and CD28 in this example). The third signal is provided by the interaction of cytokine, particularly IL-2 from type 1 T-helper (Th1) cells, and the appropriate receptor. Interactions of costimulatory adhesion molecules and cytokines are also necessary for proliferation and maturation of Tc cells. The costimulatory signals for Tc-cell maturation are virtually the same as has been described for Th-cell maturation: B7 on the cell-presenting antigen and CD28 on the T cell, CD48 on the antigen-presenting cell and CD2 on the T cell, and a variety of other adhesion molecules. Development of Tc cells also requires cytokines, especially IL-2, produced by the Th1 cell. As with B cells, some of the Tc cells that become activated in response to antigen presentation will not become effectors that destroy infected targets, but instead develop into a population of T-memory cells.31 These cells have the capacity to rapidly respond to further exposure to the same antigen. Superantigens Several pathogenic viruses and bacteria manipulate the normal interaction between APCs and Th1 cells to the detriment of the individual and the benefit of the microbe. A group of microbial molecules called superantigens (SAgs) binds to a portion of the TCR outside its normal antigen-specific binding site (usually to the V region of the β chain) and to MHC class II molecules outside their antigen-presentation sites (either to the α or to the β chain, depending on the particular SAg) (Fig. 8.22). These molecules are not digested and processed by an APC to be presented to an immune cell. Binding results in adherence of the TCR and MHC class II molecules, independent of antigen recognition, and provides a signal for Th-cell activation and proliferation. Other SAgs may bind to costimulatory molecules, such as CD28, and induce similar polyclonal Th-cell activation. FIGURE 8.22 Superantigens. The T-cell receptor (TCR) and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule normally simultaneously interact with a processed antigen to induce T-cell differentiation. Superantigens, such as some bacterial toxins, bind directly to the TCR and the MHC class II molecules. Superantigens activate Th cells independently of TCR antigen specificity. V, Variable; Vα, variable region of the α chain; Vβ, variable region of the β chain. The normal antigen-specific recognition between Th cells and APCs results in activation of relatively few cells (fewer than 0.1% of Th cells): only those cells with specific TCRs against that antigen. SAgs induce polyclonal Th-cell activation (up to 25% of Th cells) regardless of the antigen specificity of the TCRs. SAg-activated T cells overproduce cytokines, especially IFN-γ, which is an activator of phenotype macrophage 1 (M1) macrophages. Extensive M1 macrophage activation leads to secretion of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, which are primary mediators of systemic inflammatory responses. The overproduction of inflammatory cytokines results in symptoms of a systemic inflammatory reaction, including fever, low blood pressure, and, potentially, fatal shock. Some examples of SAgs are the bacterial toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (including the superantigens that cause toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning).32 Effector Mechanisms Antibody Function Protection Against Infection The chief function of circulating antibodies is to protect against infection. Protection can be afforded by antibody in several ways, either directly or indirectly (Fig. 8.23). Directly, antibody can cause neutralization (inactivating or blocking the binding of an antigen to a receptor), agglutination (clumping insoluble particles that are in suspension), or precipitation (making a soluble antigen into an insoluble precipitate) of infectious agents or their toxic products. Indirectly, antibodies activate several components of innate immunity, including complement and phagocytes. FIGURE 8.23 Direct and Indirect Functions of Antibody. Protective activities of antibodies can be direct (through the action of antibody alone) or indirect (requiring activation of other components of the innate immune response, usually through the Fc region). Direct means include neutralization of viruses or bacterial toxins before they bind to receptors on the surface of the host's cells. Indirect means include activation of the classical complement pathway through C1, resulting in formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), or by increased phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized with antibody and complement components bound to appropriate surface receptors (FcR and C3bR). Direct Effects. Many pathogens initiate infection by attaching to specific receptors on cells. Viruses that cause the common cold or influenza must attach to specific receptors on respiratory epithelial cells. Some bacteria, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae that causes gonorrhea, must attach to specific sites on urogenital epithelial cells. Antibodies may protect against infection by covering sites on the microorganism that are needed for attachment. Neutralization, or prevention of attachment to the host cell, thereby prevents infection of the host. Many viral infections can be prevented by vaccination with inactivated or attenuated (weakened) viruses designed to induce neutralizing antibody production at the site of the entrance of the virus into the body. Vaccination against influenza using an inhaled vaccine particularly induces protective IgA in the respiratory tract. Viruses found in the bloodstream also may be agglutinated by antibody, rendering them unable to infect cells. Some bacteria secrete toxins that harm individuals. For instance, specific bacterial toxins cause the symptoms of tetanus or diphtheria. Most toxins are proteins that bind to surface molecules on cells and damage those cells. Protective antibodies produced against the toxin (referred to as antitoxins) can bind to the toxins, prevent their interaction with cells, and neutralize their biologic effects. Additionally, antibody may precipitate soluble toxins and prevent binding to cells. Detection of the presence of an antibody response against a specific toxin can aid in the diagnosis of diseases. Group A streptococcal bacteria produce a toxin, streptolysin O, that destroys cells, particularly erythrocytes and leukocytes. The infected individual produces an antibody that can neutralize this toxin (antistreptolysin O) and can be detected in laboratory tests as a useful diagnostic tool for infections with group A streptococci. Vaccines that induce protective antibody against toxins are commonly used. To prevent harming the recipient of immunization, bacterial toxins are chemically inactivated to destroy their harmful properties but still retain immunogenicity. These are referred to as toxoids. Examples of bacterial pathogens for which immunization with toxoids can provide immunologic protection include those that cause diphtheria and tetanus (others are discussed in Chapter 10). Indirect effects. Indirectly, through the Fc portion, antibodies activate components of innate immunity, including complement and phagocytes (see Fig. 8.23). Through the classical pathway, complement component C1 will be activated by binding simultaneously to the Fc regions of two adjacent antibodies bound to a microbe, resulting in activation of the entire cascade (see Chapter 7). Phagocytic cells express receptors that bind the Fc portion of antibody and components of the complement cascade (e.g., C3b); thus antibody and complement are opsonins that facilitate phagocytosis of bacteria. Additionally, activation of the complement cascade may damage or destroy some infectious microbes. IgM is the best complement-activating antibody, and IgG is the best opsonin. Because bacteria are coated with several proteins and carbohydrates, each of which has multiple antigenic determinants, a normal antibody response usually consists of a mixed population of classes, specificities, and capacity to provide the functions previously listed. Some of these antibodies are more protective than others. It is now a common procedure to clone the “best” antibodies (monoclonal antibodies) for use in diagnostic tests and for therapy (see Box E 8.1 on Evolve). Secretory Immune Response Immunocompetent lymphocytes migrate among secondary lymphoid organs and tissues as part of the systemic immune system. A distinct set of lymphoid tissues makes up another, partially independent, immune system that protects the external surfaces of the body through lacrimal and salivary glands and a network of lymphoid tissues residing in the breast, bronchi, intestines, and genitourinary tract. This system is called the secretory (mucosal) immune system (Fig. 8.24). Immunocompetent lymphocytes of the systemic immune system travel through the spleen and lymph nodes where they undergo clonal selection and mature into plasma cells. Lymphocytes destined for the secretory immune system undergo a different pattern of migration to mucosal areas where they undergo clonal selection and maturation. Plasma cells in those sites secrete antibodies (secretory immunoglobulins) into bodily secretions, such as tears, sweat, saliva, mucus, and breast milk, to prevent pathogenic microorganism from infecting the body's surfaces and possibly penetrating to cause systemic disease. FIGURE 8.24 Secretory Immune System. Lymphocytes from the mucosalassociated lymphoid tissues circulate throughout the body in a pattern separate from other lymphocytes. For example, lymphocytes from the gutassociated lymphoid tissue circulate through the regional lymph nodes, the thoracic duct, and the blood and return to other mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues rather than to lymphoid tissue of the systemic immune system. IgA is the dominant secretory immunoglobulin, although IgM and IgG also are present in secretions. The primary role of IgA is to prevent the attachment and invasion of pathogens through mucosal membranes, such as those of the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and genitourinary tracts.33 Dimeric IgA antibodies containing the J chain are produced by plasma cells of the mucosa. Mucosal epithelium expresses a cell surface immunoglobulin receptor that binds and internalizes IgA. The IgA, along with the epithelial receptor (secretory piece), is secreted as secretory IgA (sIgA). The lymphoid tissues of the secretory immune system are connected; thus many foreign antigens in a mother's gastrointestinal tract (e.g., poliovirus) induce secretion of specific antibodies into the breast milk (colostral antibodies). Colostral antibodies may protect the nursing newborn against infectious disease agents that enter through the gastrointestinal tract. Although colostral antibodies provide the newborn with passive immunity against gastrointestinal infections, they do not provide systemic immunity because transport across the newborn's gut into the bloodstream shuts down after the first 24 hours of life. Maternal antibodies that pass across the placenta into the fetus before birth provide passive systemic immunity. Local protection is a distinct advantage to combat infectious microorganisms that are inhaled, swallowed, or otherwise come into contact with external body surfaces. Once they have taken up residence in the external layers of the body, harmful microorganisms can cause local disease or possibly penetrate the barriers described in Chapter 7 to cause systemic disease. Alternatively, the microorganisms may reside in the mucosal membranes without causing disease, and may be shed and cause infection in other individuals. For instance, in the 1950s two different vaccines were developed to prevent infection with poliovirus, which enters through the gastrointestinal tract. The Sabin vaccine was administered orally as an attenuated (i.e., inactivated so as to render the virus relatively harmless) live virus. This route caused a transient, limited infection and induced effective systemic and secretory immunity, preventing both the disease and the establishment of a carrier state. The Salk vaccine, on the other hand, consisted of killed viruses that were administered by injection into the skin. It induced adequate systemic protection but did not generally prevent an intestinal carrier state. Thus recipients of the Salk vaccine were protected from disease but could still shed the virus and infect others. The mechanisms and functions of antigen-antibody binding are the same in the secretory immune system as they are in the systemic immune systems; that is, binding neutralizes or opsonizes the antigen, preventing it from harming the host. The major differences between the two systems include (1) the order of utilization—the secretory immune response is incorporated as part of the body's first-line defense, whereas the systemic response is the body's final defense to prevent spread of infection to internal organs; (2) the lymphocytes of each system follow different paths of migration and pass through different secondary lymphoid tissues; and (3) the secretory response occurs locally and externally (in body secretions), whereas the systemic response occurs systemically and internally (in blood and tissues). IgE IgE is a special class of antibody that is designed to help protect the individual from infection with large parasitic worms (helminths).34 However, when IgE is produced against relatively innocuous environmental antigens, it is also the primary cause of common allergies (e.g., hay fever, dust allergies, bee stings). The role of IgE in allergies is discussed in Chapter 9. Large multicellular parasites usually invade mucosal tissues (Fig. 8.25). In response to parasitic antigens, a variety of different antibody classes are produced with many B cells class-switching to IgEsecreting plasma cells under the direction of Th2 cells primarily producing IL-4 and IL-13. IgG, IgM, and IgA bind to the surface of parasites, activate complement, generate chemotactic factors for neutrophils and macrophages, and serve as opsonins for those phagocytic cells. The influx of neutrophils and macrophages progressively leads to development of a granulomatous response around the parasite. Unique to parasitic infections, the eosinophil is a primary cell in the granuloma and the only cell that can adequately damage the parasite because of the special contents of its granules: major basic protein (binds to heparin sulfate proteoglycans), eosinophil cationic protein (a member of the RNase A family), eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil neurotoxin. The influx of eosinophils results from IgE-triggered mast cell degranulation. FIGURE 8.25 IgE Function. Soluble antigens from a parasitic infection are processed by local antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and presented to Th2 cells (1), which respond by producing cytokines that favor class-switch to IgE production (2). B cells bind soluble parasite antigen, and some switch to producing IgG, whereas others switch to IgE. The secreted IgE molecules bind to IgE-specific receptors (FcεR) on the mast cell surface (3). Additional soluble parasite antigen cross-links IgE-FcεR complexes on the mast cell surface (4), leading to mast cell degranulation and release of many proinflammatory products, including eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) (5). Eosinophils have receptors for ECF-A (ECFR) and are stimulated to increase adherence to the vessel walls and initiate diapedesis (6) and invasion of the surrounding tissue. The eosinophil also responds by increasing the density of surface receptors for IgG (FcγR) and complement component C3b (C3bR) (7). IgG had previously attached to the antigens on the parasite's surface and activated the complement cascade (C′ activation) in a failed attempt to damage the parasite. The eosinophil attaches to the parasite's surface through Fc and C3b receptors (8). Once bound to the parasite, the eosinophil releases its lysosomal enzymes onto the parasite, damaging its outer membrane (9). Th2, Type 2 T-helper cell. Mast cells in the tissues have very high affinity Fc receptors for IgE. IgE antibody against antigens of the parasite are rapidly bound to the mast cell surface. Soluble parasite molecules with multiple antigenic determinants diffuse to neighboring mast cells and bind to multiple IgE-Fc receptors and initiate mast cell degranulation (see Chapter 7). Eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) is released from mast cell granules and attracts eosinophils to the site of infection, as well as up-regulates surface receptors for IgG and complement component C3b. Eosinophil attachment to the parasite through these opsonins results in degranulation, releasing a variety of very toxic proteins at the eosinophil/parasite interface. These can cause extensive and lethal damage to the parasite if an adequate number of eosinophils are involved. T-Lymphocyte Function Killing Abnormal Cells T-Cytotoxic Lymphocytes. T-cytotoxic lymphocytes (Tc cells) are responsible for the cellmediated destruction of tumor cells or cells infected with viruses. In a fashion similar to intercellular recognition during the clonal selection process, the Tc cell must directly adhere to the target cell through TCR/CD8 recognition of antigen presented by MHC class I molecules (Fig. 8.26). Because of the broad cellular distribution of MHC class I molecules, Tc cells can recognize antigen on the surface of almost any type of cell that has been infected by a virus or has become cancerous. Unlike clonal selection, the roles of costimulatory signals through adhesion molecules and cytokines are of less importance here. FIGURE 8.26 Cell Killing Mechanisms. Several cells have the capacity to kill abnormal (e.g., virally infected, cancerous) target cells. T-cytotoxic (Tc) cells recognized endogenous antigen presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (cell on upper left). The intercellular interaction is enhanced through a variety of costimulatory adhesion molecules (not shown). The Tc cell mobilizes multiple killing mechanisms that induce apoptosis of the target cell, including the secretion of perforin that creates pores for the entrance of granzymes into the target cell and stimulation of Fas molecules on the target cell surface by Fas ligand (FasL) on the Tc cell. Natural killer (NK) cells (cells on right) use the same mechanisms to kill target cells through activation receptors that recognize “abnormal surface changes.” NK cells specifically kill targets that have down-regulated expression of surface MHC class I molecules. Targets expressing MHC class I molecules inactivate NK cells through a variety of inactivation receptors (cell on upper right). Several cells, including macrophages and NK cells, can kill by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). IgG antibody binds to foreign antigen on the target cell. Cells involved in ADCC (cell on lower left) bind IgG through Fc receptors (FcRs) and initiate killing. The insert is a scanning electron microscopic view of Tc cells (L) attacking a much larger tumor cell (Tu). (Insert from Abbas A, Lichtman A: Cellular and molecular immunology, ed 5, Philadelphia, 2003, Saunders.) After attachment to a target cell, killing can occur by at least two different mechanisms that induce apoptosis: through the actions of perforin and granzyme or by direct receptor interactions. Perforins and granzymes are contained in Tc-cell lysosomal granules, which are released onto the surface of the target cell. Perforin acts in a fashion similar to C9 of the complement cascade and penetrates, polymerizes, and forms pores in the target cell's plasma membrane. The granzymes enter the target cell through the perforin-lined pores and activate cellular enzymes (caspases) that initiate apoptosis and death of the target. Additionally, target cell apoptosis can be induced directly through the stimulation of specific receptors on the cell surface. For instance, Tc cells express a surface molecule called Fas ligand, which is very similar to TNF-α and reacts with a protein called Fas (CD95) on the target cell surface. Activation of Fas signals the target cell to undergo apoptosis. Other Cells That Kill Abnormal Cells. Various other cells kill targets in a fashion similar to Tc lymphocytes. Prominent among these cells are natural killer (NK) cells (see Chapter 7). NK cells are a special group of lymphoid cells that are similar to Tc cells.35 NK cells are not selected in the thymus and lack antigenspecific receptors. Instead, they express a variety of cell surface activation receptors (similar to pattern recognition receptors, see Chapter 7) that identify protein changes on the surface of cells infected with viruses or that have become cancerous. After attachment, the NK cell kills its target in a manner similar to that of Tc cells. NK cells also have receptors for MHC class I. However, NK cells lack CD8 so that binding to MHC class I molecules results in an inactivation signal in the NK cell. NK cells complement the target cell specificity of Tc cells; Tc cells kill targets that express MHC class I, and NK cells kill targets that do not express MHC class I (see Fig. 8.26). In some instances, a virus infected or cancerous cell will “protect” itself by down-regulating MHC class I molecule expression. Without surface MHC class I molecules a cell becomes resistant to Tc-cell recognition and killing. However, suppression of MHC class I results in vulnerability to NK cells. Thus Tc cells kill abnormal cells that continue to express MHC class I, whereas NK cells kill abnormal cells that have suppressed MHC class I expression. NK cells, as well as some macrophages, can specifically kill targets through the use of antibodies. NK cells express Fc receptors for IgG (CD16, a marker for NK cells). If antigens on the cell are infected with virus or a cancerous cell binds IgG, the NK cell can attach through the Fc receptors and activate its normal killing mechanisms. This is referred to as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (see Fig. 8.26). Another population of NK-like cells has been identified, NK-T cells. NK-T cells are produced in the thymus and more closely resemble Tc cells. However, they express TCRs that have very limited variability and recognize antigens presented by CD1. T Cells That Activate Macrophages Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells produce cytokines that amplify inflammation. Th1 cells secrete cytokines that activate M1 macrophages to increase phagocytosis and microbial killing36 (see Fig. 8.27 and described in Chapter 7). The most important Th1-cell cytokine for M1 macrophage activation is interferon-γ (IFN-γ). IFN-γ– induced macrophage activation is also achieved by NK cells and CD8+ Tc cells. Additional signals (e.g., the CXC chemokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor) retain macrophages at inflammatory sites and increase intercellular adhesion between the Th1 cell (CD40L) and the macrophage (CD40). Th2 cells secrete cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) that activate M2 macrophages for healing and repair of damaged tissue (described in Chapter 7). Th17 cells secrete a set of cytokines (e.g., IL-17, IL-21, IL-22) that recruit phagocytic cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, to a site of inflammation.37 Th17 cell cytokines also may activate cells, particularly epithelial cells, to produce antimicrobial proteins in defense against certain bacterial and fungal pathogens. IL-17 cytokines induce epithelial cell chemokines and neutrophil infiltration, and IL-22 affects production of antimicrobial protein by epithelial cells. Thus Th17 cells control many aspects of inflammation, including chronic inflammation. FIGURE 8.27 Activation of a Macrophage by a T Cell. A population of T cells that helps immune and inflammatory responses (T-helper cells or Th1 cells) produces cytokines that activate macrophages. Optimal macrophage activation also requires close contact among the cells, which is mediated by a variety of adhesion molecules expressed on the surface of each cell (CD40L and CD40 shown here). CD40L, CD40 ligand; IFN-γ, interferongamma; IFN-γR, receptor for interferon-gamma. (Micrograph in A courtesy Dr. Noel Weidner, Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego.

T-Regulatory Lymphocytes T-regulatory (Treg) cells are a diverse group of T cells that control the immune response, usually suppressing the response and maintaining tolerance against self-antigens. This process occurs in the secondary lymphoid organs and other tissues; therefore it is referred to as peripheral tolerance,38 in contrast to the process of central tolerance described earlier. This population of Treg cells that differentiates from the Th-cell population expresses CD4 and binds to antigens presented by MHC class II molecules (see Fig. 8.16). Unlike other Th cells, however, Treg cells express consistently high levels of CD25 (the α chain of the IL-2 receptor) and are frequently designated CD4+, CD25+ Treg cells. Differentiation from the Th precursor cell is controlled primarily by TGF-β and IL-2. Treg cells produce very high levels of the immunosuppressive cytokines TGF-β and IL-10, which generally decrease Th1 and Th2 activity by suppressing antigen recognition and Th-cell proliferation. B-regulatory (Breg) cells contain a population of B cells that functions in a similar fashion to Treg cells. Breg cells control peripheral tolerance through the production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, IL-35, TGF-β) that suppress proliferation of autoreactive Th cells.39 Fetal and Neonatal Immune Function The normal human infant is immunologically immature at birth. Although cell-mediated immunologic capabilities begin developing early in gestation and probably are completely functional at birth, phagocytic activity, antibody production, and complement activity are clearly deficient. In the last trimester, the fetus appears capable of producing a primary immune response (almost entirely IgM) to in utero infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, and Toxoplasma gondii) but is unable to produce a significant IgG response. Although some IgA can be detected, the capacity to produce IgA is underdeveloped. To protect the child against infectious agents both in utero and during the first few postnatal months, a system of active transport facilitates the passage of maternal antibodies into the fetal circulation (Fig. 8.28). In the placenta, maternal and fetal blood is separated by a layer of specialized multinucleate cells termed syncytiotrophoblasts. Immunoglobulins are too large to diffuse across this cellular layer so the trophoblastic cells actively transport immunoglobulins from the maternal to the fetal circulation. Active transport of maternal IgG is mediated by surface receptors that are specific for the Fc portion of free IgG but not for IgM, IgE, or IgA. Active transport sometimes results in higher antibody titers in umbilical cord blood than in maternal blood. (Active transport mechanisms are discussed in Chapter 1.) FIGURE 8.28 Transport of IgG Across the Syncytiotrophoblast. The human placenta is covered with a specialized multinucleated cell, the syncytiotrophoblast. Transport of maternal IgG across the syncytiotrophoblast and into the fetal circulation is an active process. Maternal IgG binds to Fc receptors on the surface of the syncytiotrophoblast and is internalized by the process of endocytosis. Receptors on the syncytiotrophoblast are specific for the Fc portion of IgG and do not bind other classes of immunoglobulins. Interaction of IgG with Fc receptors protects the antibody from lysosomal digestion during transport of the vacuole across the cell (i.e., transcytosis). On the fetal side of the syncytiotrophoblast, IgG is released by exocytosis (see Chapter 1). At birth, total IgG levels in the umbilical cord are near adult levels (Fig. 8.29). When the source of maternal antibodies is severed at birth, antibody titers in the newborn begin to drop as maternal antibody is catabolized. Thus antibody titers drop rapidly as the neonate's production of IgG is beginning to rise. The rate of catabolism is usually more rapid than the rate of production so that the total immunoglobulin levels reach a minimum at 5 to 6 months in the normal child, occasionally causing transient hypogammaglobulinemia (insufficient quantities of circulating immunoglobulins). Many normal infants experience recurrent mild respiratory tract infections at this age. FIGURE 8.29 Antibody Levels in Umbilical Cord Blood and in Neonatal Circulation. Early in gestation, maternal IgG begins crossing the placenta and enters the fetal circulation. At birth, the fetal circulation may contain nearly adult levels of IgG, which is almost exclusively from the maternal source. The fetal immune system has the capacity to produce IgM and small amounts of IgA before birth (not shown). After delivery, maternal IgG is rapidly catabolized and neonatal IgG production increases. Aging and Immune Function Immune function decreases with age as a result of changes in both lymphocyte function and relative lymphocyte populations. Individuals older than 60 years of age generally exhibit decreased Tcell activity as demonstrated by laboratory assays of T-cell function, as well as in vivo reductions in cell-mediated responses to infections. The thymus, where T cells begin their development, reaches its maximum size at sexual maturity and then undergoes involution until the thymus is only 15% of its maximum size by middle age.40 Decrease in thymic activity is accompanied by decreased production of thymic hormones, and the capacity to mediate T-cell differentiation decreases with this atrophy. Although the total number of circulating T cells does not decrease with age, there is a shift in the populations of T-cell subtypes. B-cell function is also altered with age as shown by decreases in specific antibody production in response to antigenic challenge, with concomitant increases in circulating immune complexes and in circulating autoantibodies (antibodies against self-antigens). A decrease in the number of circulating memory B cells is also observed. Summary Review General Characteristics of Adaptive Immunity 1. The third line of defense is adaptive immunity, often called the immune response. It consists of lymphocytes and serum proteins called antibodies. The adaptive immune response develops more slowly than inflammation and is exquisitely specific in response to a particular infectious agent. 2. Compared with the innate inflammatory response, the adaptive immune response is slower, is specific (rather than nonspecific or general), and has “memory” that makes it much longer lived. 3. The adaptive immune response is most often initiated by cells of the innate system. These cells process and present portions of invading pathogens (i.e., antigens) to lymphocytes in peripheral lymphoid tissue. 4. The adaptive immune response is mediated by two different types of lymphocytes—B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. Each has distinct functions. B cells are responsible for humoral immunity that is mediated by circulating antibodies, whereas T cells are responsible for cell-mediated immunity, in which they kill targets directly or stimulate the activity of other leukocytes. 5. Both T cells and B cells are programmed to recognize only one specific antigen before having encountered that antigen. B and T cells have an extensive diversity of antigen receptors capable of recognizing different antigens. This process is called clonal diversity. Clonal selection is initiated by exposure to foreign antigen usually related to infection. 6. Most antigens need to be processed (antigen processing) by phagocytic cells, primarily dendritic cells. These cells also present processed antigen on their surfaces and present (antigen presentation) the antigen to lymphocytes. These antigen-presenting cells (APCs) define clonal selection involving APCs and subsets of B and T cells. B cells develop into plasma cells and become factories for the production of antibody. 7. T cells develop into subsets that identify and kill a target cell (T-cytotoxic [Tc cell]), regulate the immune response (T-helper cell [Th cell]), or suppress or limit the immune response (Tregulatory [Treg cell]). Both B and T cells also differentiate into very long-lived memory cells. 8. Antibodies and T cells both protect against infection. Antibody is primarily responsible for protection against many bacteria and viruses. This arm of the immune response is termed the humoral immune response, or humoral immunity. 9. Effector T cells are found in the blood and in tissues and organs and defend against intracellular pathogens (e.g., some viruses) and cancer cells. This arm of the immune response is termed the cellular immune response, or cellular immunity. 10. Active immunity (active acquired immunity) is produced by an individual either after natural exposure to an antigen or after immunization, whereas passive immunity (passive acquired immunity) does not involve the host's immune response at all. Rather, passive immunity occurs when preformed antibodies or T lymphocytes are transferred from a donor to the recipient. 11. Passive immunity can occur naturally, as in the passage of maternal antibodies across the placenta to the fetus, or artificially, as in a clinic using immunotherapy for a specific disease. Recognition and Response 1. Antigens are the molecules that can react with components of the adaptive immune system, including antibodies and lymphocyte surface receptors. Immunogens are antigens that can initiate the adaptive immune response. To be immunogenic, an antigen must be of the correct type, size, and complexity and be present in sufficient quantities. Haptens are small-molecular-weight antigens that are not themselves immunogenic. 2. Both B and T lymphocytes bind antigen through cognate receptor complexes on their surfaces. These receptor complexes (i.e., the BCR and TCR complexes, respectively) work in conjunction with accessory proteins to produce lymphocyte activation. 3. The antigen-binding molecule of the BCR is antibody. Antibodies are composed of four polypeptide chains—two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains—held together by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain has a variable region and a large constant region. Each light chain has a variable region and a short constant region. The class of antibody is determined by which constant regions make up their heavy chains, giving each class a slightly different molecular structure. The classes include IgG (the most prevalent), IgA (mostly in secretions), IgE (the most rare), IgD, and IgM (the first and largest immunoglobulin produced). The parts of antibody that bind antigen are called the Fab, and the part that reacts with cells and molecules of the innate system is called the Fc. Antigen binds to hypervariable regions (complementary-determining regions, or CDRs) of both the heavy and the light chains. 4. For most antigens to elicit an immune response, they must be presented to lymphocytes by molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Endogenous protein antigens are presented by class I molecules of MHC. Exogenous protein antigens are presented by class II MHC molecules. Lipid antigens are presented by CD1. 5. The MHC is a cluster of genes found on human chromosome 6. The products of these genes are also called HLA antigens. The MHC genes are highly polymorphic, having many different possible alleles. An individual will carry only two alleles at each locus, one from each parent. The particular combination of alleles given individuals carry define their MHC haplotype. 6. For an immune response to develop, a variety of cells must interact through surface adhesion molecules. 7. During their interactions, cells must communicate with each other through soluble cytokines. In addition to their roles in the innate immune response, cytokines have multiple functions in the adaptive immune response including both positive and negative regulation of B-cell and T-cell maturation. In general, it is the precise combination of cytokines influencing a given cell that ultimately determines that cell's response. Generation of Clonal Diversity 1. The generation of clonal diversity occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells) in the fetus. 2. An individual's population of T cells and B cells has the collective ability to respond to virtually any antigen. This ability results from genetic rearrangement of various genes to form the variable regions for the TCR and BCR. Rearrangement of V and J genes results in the variable regions of the TCR α chain and the BCR light chain, and rearrangement of V, D, and J genes results in the variable regions of the TCR β chain and the BCR heavy chain. 3. Differentiation of B cells and T cells in the primary lymphoid organs results in expression of several characteristic surface markers, such as CD4 on helper T cells, CD8 on cytotoxic T cells, and CD21 and CD40 on B cells. 4. During generation of clonal diversity, B cells and T cells that produce receptors against self-antigens are eliminated by a process of central tolerance. 5. Cells leaving the primary lymphoid organs are immunocompetent (capable of reacting to antigen) and enter the circulation and secondary lymphoid organs. Induction of an Immune Response: Clonal Selection 1. Clonal selection is the process by which antigen selects lymphocytes with complementary TCRs or BCRs and induces an immune response with the production of specific antibody or cytotoxic T cells, or both. 2. For lymphocyte activation, most antigens must be processed and presented by an APC in the context of the appropriate molecule, either MHC class I, MHC class II, or CD1 molecules. 3. Most immune responses require T-helper cells (Th cells). Precursor Th cells interact with APCs through the TCR-CD4 complex, a variety of adhesion molecules, and cytokines, especially IL-1, and develop into either Th1 or Th2 subsets. Th1 cells are responsible for helping to activate macrophages and cytotoxic T cells, whereas Th2 cells are responsible for helping to activate B cells. 4. Another set of Th cells, Th17 cells, provides help in developing inflammation, particularly attraction of neutrophils and macrophages and induction of chemokine and antimicrobial protein production by epithelial cells. 5. B-cell activation results from recognition of soluble antigen by the BCR, processing of the antigen, and presentation by MHC class II antigens to Th2 cells. Interactions between the B cells and Th2 cells through adhesion molecules (e.g., CD40 and CD40L) are also required. Depending on the particular combination of cytokines produced by the Th2 cell, the B cells can undergo class-switch from making IgM antibody to making and secreting either IgA, IgE, or IgG. 6. The humoral immune response is divided into two phases, primary and secondary. These differ in the relative amounts of IgG produced—the secondary response having a much higher proportion of IgG relative to IgM. The two responses also differ in the speed with which each occurs after antigen challenge—the secondary response being much more rapid than the primary response because of the presence of memory cells in the secondary phase. 7. B cells become activated upon recognition of a particular antigen to proliferate and differentiate either into plasma cells that function as factories for the synthesis of large amounts of antibody that is specific for the recognized antigen or into memory B cells. 8. T-cell activation results from recognition by the TCR and CD8 of antigen presented by MHC class I. Appropriate intercellular adhesion molecules and cytokines, such as IL-2 from Th1 cells, are also necessary for efficient differentiation. T cells become cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTLs) or memory T cells. 9. Superantigens are molecules produced by infectious agents that can bind to the TCR of the Th cell outside the normal antigen-binding site and to class II MHC on the APCs, resulting in activation of a large number of Th cells and excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines that may cause shock and death of the patient. Examples of these antigens, called superantigens, include the bacterial toxins that can cause toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning. Effector Mechanisms 1. The antibodies that are produced by B cells affect antigens by several different mechanisms that can be categorized as either direct or indirect. Direct mechanisms are mediated by the antigen-binding portions of antibodies (the Fab portions containing the variable regions). This binding results in neutralization of the biologic activity of antigens and possibly removal of the antigen by agglutination or precipitation. Indirect mechanisms depend on both the Fab and the non– antigen-binding portion of antibodies (the Fc portions containing the constant regions), which interact with components of innate immunity. 2. Antibodies of the systemic immune system function throughout the body, whereas antibodies of the secretory (mucosal) immune system—primarily immunoglobulins of the IgA class—are associated with bodily secretions and function to prevent pathogenic infection on epithelial surfaces. 3. T-cytotoxic cells (Tc cells) adhere directly to antigen presented by MHC class I on target cells (virus-infected cells or cancer cells) through the TCR, CD8, and a variety of adhesion proteins. This contact results in killing of the target by apoptosis through the release of perforin and granzymes and/or direct stimulation of apoptotic receptors on the target (e.g., Fas). 4. NK cells kill targets in a fashion similar to that of Tc cells. However, NK cells recognize target cells that do not express MHC class I. 5. Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells produce cytokines that amplify inflammation. Th1 cells secrete cytokines that activate M1 macrophages to increase phagocytosis and microbial killing. The most important Th1 cell cytokine for M1 macrophage activation is interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Th2 cells secrete cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) that activate M2 macrophages for healing and repair of damaged tissue (described in Chapter 7). Th17 cells secrete a set of cytokines (e.g., IL-17, IL-21, IL-22) that recruit phagocytic cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, to a site of inflammation. 6. T-regulatory (Treg) cells are a diverse group of T cells that control the immune response, usually suppressing the response and maintaining tolerance against self-antigens. This process occurs in the secondary lymphoid organs and other tissues; therefore it is referred to as peripheral tolerance. 7. B-regulatory (Breg) cells contain a population of B cells that functions in a similar fashion to Treg cells. Breg cells control peripheral tolerance through the production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, IL-35, TGF-β) that suppress proliferation of autoreactive Th cells. Fetal and Neonatal Immune Function 1. The human neonate has a poorly developed immune response, particularly in the production of IgG. The fetus and neonate are protected in utero and during the first few postnatal months by maternal antibody that was actively transported across the placenta. 2. The maternal antibodies are slowly catabolized after birth until they disappear altogether by about 10 months of age. At birth, total IgG levels in the umbilical cord are near adult levels. The neonate begins producing IgG at birth, and the child's antibodies reach protective levels after about 6 months of age. Aging and Immune Function 1. T-cell activity is deficient in older adults, and a shift in the balance of T-cell subsets is observed. These changes may result in increased susceptibility to infection. 2. Antibody production to specific antigens is inferior, although older adults tend to have increased levels of circulating autoantibodies.

Sometimes this network breaks down, causing the immune system to react inappropriately. Inappropriate immune responses may be (1) exaggerated against environmental antigens (allergy); (2) misdirected against the host's own cells (autoimmunity); (3) directed against beneficial foreign tissues, such as transfusions or transplants (alloimmunity); or (4) be insufficient to protect the host (immune deficiency). All of these can be serious or life threatening. Exaggerated immune responses (allergy) are the most common, but usually the least life threatening. Hypersensitivity: Allergy, Autoimmunity, and Alloimmunity Hypersensitivity is an altered immunologic response to an antigen that results in disease or damage to the host. Hypersensitivity reactions can be classified in two ways: by the source of the antigen that the immune system is attacking (allergy, autoimmunity, alloimmunity; Table 9.1) and by the mechanism that causes disease (types I, II, III, and IV; see Table 9.3). Allergy originally denoted both facets of the immune response: immunity, which is beneficial, and hypersensitivity, which is harmful. Allergy has now come to mean the deleterious effects of hypersensitivity to environmental antigens, and immunity means the protective responses to antigens expressed by disease-causing agents.

An example of each reaction is given. Autoimmunity is a disturbance in the immunologic tolerance of self-antigens. The immune system normally does not strongly recognize the individual's own antigens. Healthy individuals of all ages, but particularly older adults, may produce low quantities of antibodies against their own antigens (autoantibodies), without development of overt autoimmune disease. Therefore, the presence of low quantities of autoantibodies does not necessarily indicate a disease state. Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system reacts against self-antigens to such a degree that the person's own tissues are damaged by autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells. Many clinical disorders are associated with autoimmunity and are collectively referred to as autoimmune diseases (Table 9.2).

Alloimmunity can be observed during immunologic reactions against transfusions, transplanted tissue, or the fetus during pregnancy. The mechanism that initiates the onset of hypersensitivity, whether it consists of allergy, autoimmunity, or alloimmunity, is not completely understood. It is generally accepted that genetic, infectious, and possibly environmental factors contribute to hypersensitivity. Most diseases caused by hypersensitivity develop because of the interactions of at least three variables: (1) an original “insult,” which alters immunologic homeostasis (a steady state of tolerance to self-antigens or lack of immune reaction against environmental antigens); (2) the individual's genetic makeup, which determines the degree of the resultant immune response from the effects of the insult; and (3) an immunologic process that causes the symptoms of the disease. Mechanisms of Hypersensitivity Diseases caused by hypersensitivity reactions can be characterized also by the particular immune mechanism that results in the disease (see Table 9.1). These mechanisms are apparent in most hypersensitivity reactions and have been divided into four distinct types: type I (immunoglobulin E [IgE]–mediated) hypersensitivity reactions, type II (tissue-specific) hypersensitivity reactions, type III (immune complex–mediated) hypersensitivity reactions, and type IV (cell-mediated) hypersensitivity reactions (Table 9.3).1 This classification is artificial and seldom is a particular disease associated with only a single mechanism. The four mechanisms are interrelated, and in most hypersensitivity reactions, several mechanisms can be at work simultaneously or sequentially. Some of the mechanisms are secondary to the disease and not directly involved in the pathologic process, whereas others are the primary cause of tissue destruction.

Hypersensitivity reactions require sensitization against a particular antigen that results in primary and secondary immune responses. An individual is sensitized when an adequate amount of antibodies or T cells is available to cause a noticeable reaction on reexposure to the antigen. Some individuals become sensitized quite rapidly (after an apparent single exposure to the antigen), whereas others require multiple exposures that may occur over years. After sensitization has been achieved, hypersensitivity reactions can be immediate or delayed, depending on the time between reexposure to the antigen and the onset of clinical symptoms. Reactions that occur within minutes to a few hours are termed immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions may take several hours to appear and are at maximum severity days after reexposure to the antigen. The most rapid and severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction is anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis occurs within minutes of reexposure to the antigen and can be either systemic (generalized) or cutaneous (localized).2 Symptoms of systemic anaphylaxis include itching, erythema, headaches, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and breathing difficulties. The most severe reactions may include contraction of bronchial smooth muscle, laryngeal edema, and vascular collapse and decreased blood pressure that can lead to shock and death. Examples of systemic anaphylaxis are allergic reactions to bee stings, peanuts, eggs, and shellfish. Cutaneous anaphylaxis results in local symptoms, such as pain, swelling, and redness, which occur at the site of exposure to an antigen (e.g., a painful local reaction to an injected vaccine or drug). Type I: IgE-Mediated Hypersensitivity Reactions Type I (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by antigen-specific IgE and the products of tissue mast cells3 (Fig. 9.1). Most common allergies (e.g., pollen allergies) are type I reactions. In addition, most type I reactions occur against environmental antigens and are therefore allergic. Because of this strong association, many healthcare professionals use the term allergy to indicate only IgEmediated reactions. However, IgE can contribute to a few autoimmune and alloimmune diseases, and many common allergies (e.g., poison ivy) are not mediated by IgE. FIGURE 9.1 Mechanism of Type I IgE–Mediated Reactions. A, Th2 cells are activated by antigen-presenting dendritic cells to produce cytokines, including IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF attract and promote the survival of eosinophils. Other cytokines (e.g., IL-4) induce B cells to class-switch to IgE-producing plasma cells. The IgE coats the surface of the mast cell by binding with IgE-specific Fc receptors on the mast cell's plasma membrane (sensitization). Further exposure to the same allergen cross-links the surface-bound IgE and activates signals from the cytoplasmic portion of the IgE Fc receptors. These signals initiate two parallel and interdependent processes: mast cell degranulation and discharge of preformed mediators (e.g., histamine, eosinophil-chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis) and production of newly formed mediators such as arachidonic metabolites (leukotrienes, prostaglandins). Many local type I hypersensitivity reactions have two well-defined phases. The initial phase is characterized by vasodilation, vascular leakage, and, depending on the location, smooth muscle spasm or glandular secretions. These changes usually become evident within 5 to 30 minutes after exposure to the antigen. The late phase occurs 2 to 8 hours later without additional exposure to the antigen. The late phase has more intense infiltration of tissues with eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, and Th cells and tissue destruction in the form of mucosal epithelial cell damage. B, Activation of mast cells leading to degranulation of preformed mediators (primary mediators) and synthesis of newly formed (de novo) mediators (secondary mediators). ECF, Eosinophilic chemotactic factor; Fc, fragment crystallizable; Ig, immunoglobulin; IL, interleukin; NCF, neutrophil chemotactic factor; PAF, platelet-activating factor; Th, T-helper. In some individuals, exposure to an environmental antigen causes primarily IgE production. Repeated exposure to the antigen usually is required to elicit enough IgE so that the person becomes “sensitized.” IgE has a relatively short life span in the blood because it rapidly binds to very-high-affinity Fc receptors on the plasma membranes of mast cells (see Fig. 9.1). The subclass IgG4 also has specific receptors on the mast cell and may contribute to the type I mechanism. Antibody that binds to mast cells is termed cytotropic antibody (able to bind to cell surfaces) or reagin (skin-sensitizing antibody). Unlike Fc receptors on phagocytes, which bind IgG that has reacted with antigen, the Fc receptors on mast cells bind with IgE that has not previously interacted with antigen. If further exposure of a sensitized individual to the antigen occurs, one molecule of antigen may bind simultaneously to two molecules of IgE-Fc receptor complexes on the mast cell's surface (cross-link) resulting in activation of intracellular signaling pathways and mast cell degranulation (see Fig. 9.1, B, and Chapter 7). The antigen that triggers cross-linking must have at least two antigenic determinants on the same molecule. Sometimes an IgE-mediated response is beneficial to the host, as is the case of some immune reactions against parasites. (This mechanism is described in Chapter 8 and illustrated in Fig. 8.25.) The products of mast cell degranulation can modulate almost all aspects of an acute inflammatory response. (The effects of biochemical mediators released by mast cells are illustrated in Fig. 7.11). The most potent mediator is histamine, which affects several key target cells. Acting through the H1 receptors, histamine contracts bronchial smooth muscles, causing bronchial constriction; increases vascular permeability, causing edema; and causes vasodilation, increasing blood flow into the affected area (see Figs. 7.3 and 7.12). The interaction of histamine with H2 receptors results in increased gastric acid secretion and a decrease of histamine released from mast cells and basophils. The action of histamine through H2 receptors suggests an important negative-feedback mechanism that stops degranulation. That is, the released histamine inhibits release of additional histamine by interacting with H2 receptors on the mast cells. Histamine also may affect control of the immune response through H2 receptors on most cells of the immune system. Another important activity of histamine is enhancement of the chemotactic activity of other factors, such as eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A), which attracts eosinophils into sites of allergic inflammatory reactions and prevents them from migrating out of the inflammatory site. (The role of the eosinophil in inflammation is discussed in Chapter 7.) Blocking histamine receptors with antihistamines can control some type I responses. Mast cells also initiate synthesis of bioactive lipid-derived mediators, such as leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor (PAF), and prostaglandins. Each is released much more slowly than histamine and can mediate similar, yet more prolonged, clinical symptoms, such as recruiting inflammatory cells (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils), promoting vascular permeability and edema, inducing bronchoconstriction or rhinitis, and inducing further release of histamine from mast cells.4 Therapy includes the use of competitive inhibitors of receptors for lipid mediators. Montelukast (a leukotriene receptor inhibitor), rupatadine (a PAF receptor inhibitor), and others are in clinical use. Type II: Tissue-Specific Hypersensitivity Reactions Type II (tissue-specific) hypersensitivity reactions are generally characterized by a specific cell or tissue being the target of an immune response. In addition to major histocompatibility locus antigens (i.e., human leukocyte antigens [HLAs]; discussed in Chapter 8), most cells have other antigens on their surfaces. Some of these other antigens are called tissue-specific antigens because they are expressed on the plasma membranes of only certain cells in specific tissues. Platelets, for example, have groups of antigens that are found on no other cells of the body. The symptoms of many type II diseases are determined by which tissue or organ expresses the particular antigen. Environmental antigens (e.g., drugs or their metabolites) may bind to the plasma membranes of specific cells (especially erythrocytes and platelets) and function as targets of type II reactions. The five general mechanisms by which type II hypersensitivity reactions can affect cells are shown in Fig. 9.2. All of these mechanisms begin with antibody binding to tissue-specific antigens or antigens that have attached to particular tissues. First, the cell can be destroyed by antibody (IgG or IgM) and activation of the complement cascade through the classical pathway. Formation of the membrane attack complex (C5-9) damages the membrane and may result in lysis of the cell (see Fig. 9.2, A). For example, erythrocytes are destroyed by complement-mediated lysis in individuals with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (see Chapter 29) or as a result of an alloimmune reaction to ABO-mismatched transfused blood cells. FIGURE 9.2 Mechanisms of Type II, Tissue-Specific, Reactions. Antigens on the target cell bind with antibody and are destroyed or prevented from functioning by A, complement-mediated lysis (an erythrocyte target is illustrated here); B, clearance (phagocytosis) by macrophages in the tissue; C, neutrophil-mediated immune destruction; D, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (apoptosis of target cells is induced by granzymes and perforin produced by natural killer [NK] cells and interactions of Fas ligand [FasL] on the surface of NK cells with Fas on the surface of target cells); or E, modulation or blocking the normal function of receptors by antireceptor antibody. This example of mechanism E depicts myasthenia gravis in which acetylcholine receptor antibodies block acetylcholine from attaching to its receptors on the motor end plates of skeletal muscle, thereby impairing neuromuscular transmission and causing muscle weakness. C1, Complement component C1; C3b, complement fragment produced from C3, which acts as an opsonin; C5a, complement fragment produced from C5, which acts as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils; Fcγ receptor, cellular receptor for the Fc portion of IgG; FcR, Fc receptor. Second, antibody may cause cell destruction through phagocytosis by macrophages. IgG and also C3b of the complement system are opsonins that bind to receptors on the macrophage (see Fig. 9.2, B). Phagocytosis of the target cell follows. (Phagocytosis is illustrated in Figs. 7.15 and 7.16.) For example, antibodies against platelet-specific antigens or against red blood cell antigens of the Rh system coat those cells at low density, resulting in their preferential removal by phagocytosis in the spleen, rather than by complement-mediated lysis. Third, antibody and complement may attract neutrophils. Either antigen expressed normally on the vessel walls or soluble antigen in the circulation (e.g., released from cells within the body or from infectious agents or by way of drugs or medications) that has been deposited on the surface of endothelial cells may bind antibody (see Fig. 9.2, C). The antibody initiates the complement cascade, resulting in the release of C3a and C5a, which are chemotactic for neutrophils, and deposition of complement component C3b. Neutrophils bind to the tissues through receptors for the Fc portion of antibody (Fc receptor) or for C3b and attempt to phagocytose the tissue. Because the tissue is large, phagocytosis cannot be completed; even so, neutrophils release their granules onto the healthy tissue. The components of neutrophil granules, as well as the several toxic oxygen products produced by these cells, will damage the tissue. The fourth mechanism is antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (see Fig. 9.2, D). This mechanism involves a subpopulation of cytotoxic cells that are not antigen specific (natural killer [NK] cells). Antibody on the target cell is recognized by Fc receptors on the NK cells, which release toxic substances that destroy the target cell. The fifth mechanism does not destroy the target cell, but rather causes it to malfunction. In this mechanism of type II injury, the antibody is usually directed against antigenic determinants associated with specific cell surface receptors, and the symptoms of the disease are a result of a direct effect of antibody binding alone (see Fig. 9.2, E). The antibody reacts with the receptors on the target cell surface and modulates the function of the receptor by preventing interactions with their normal ligands, replacing the ligand and inappropriately stimulating the receptor, or destroying the receptor. For example, in the hyperthyroidism (excessive thyroid activity) of Graves disease, autoantibody binds to and activates receptors for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (a pituitary hormone that controls the production of the hormone thyroxine by the thyroid). In this way the antibody stimulates the thyroid cells to produce thyroxine. Under normal conditions, the increasing levels of thyroxine in the blood would signal the pituitary to decrease TSH production, which would result in less stimulation of the TSH receptor in the thyroid and a concomitant decrease in thyroxine production. Because the level of anti-TSH receptor antibody is not controlled by the pituitary, increasing amounts of thyroxine in the blood have no effect on antibody levels, and thyroxine production continues to increase despite decreasing amounts of TSH (see Chapter 22). Type III: Immune Complex–Mediated Hypersensitivity Reactions Mechanisms of Type III Hypersensitivity. Most type III (immune complex–mediated) hypersensitivity reactions are caused by antigen-antibody (immune) complexes that are formed in the circulation and deposited later in vessel walls or extravascular tissues (Fig. 9.3). The primary difference between type II and type III mechanisms is that in type II hypersensitivity antibody binds to the antigen on the cell surface, whereas in type III the antibody binds to soluble antigen that was released into the blood or body fluids, and the complex is then deposited in the tissues. Type III reactions are not organ specific, and symptoms have little to do with the particular antigenic target of the antibody. The harmful effects of immune complex deposition are caused by complement activation, particularly through the generation of chemotactic factors for neutrophils. The neutrophils bind to antibody and C3b contained in the complexes and attempt to ingest the immune complexes. FIGURE 9.3 Mechanism of Type III, Immune Complex–Mediated, Reactions. Immune complexes form in the blood from circulating antigen and antibody. Both small and large immune complexes are removed successfully from the circulation and do not cause tissue damage. Intermediate-sized complexes are deposited in certain target tissues in which the circulation is slow or filtration of the blood occurs. The complexes activate the complement cascade through C1 and generate fragments including C5a and C3b. C5a is chemotactic for neutrophils, which migrate into the inflamed area and attach to the IgG and C3b in the immune complexes. The neutrophils attempt unsuccessfully to phagocytose the tissue and in the process release a variety of degradative enzymes that destroy the healthy tissues. Fcγ receptor is the cellular receptor for the Fc portion of IgG. They are often unsuccessful because the complexes are bound to large areas of tissue. During the attempted phagocytosis, large quantities of lysosomal enzymes are released into the inflammatory site instead of into phagolysosomes. The attraction of neutrophils and the subsequent release of lysosomal enzymes cause most of the resulting tissue damage. Immune complexes can be of various sizes, depending on the relative amounts of antigen and antibody. Fairly large immune complexes are cleared rapidly from the circulation by tissue macrophages, whereas very small complexes eventually are filtered from blood through the kidneys, without any pathologic consequences. Intermediate-sized immune complexes (formed at a ratio of antigen to antibody that has a slight excess of antigen) are likely to be deposited in certain target tissues, where they have severe pathologic consequences, such as inflammation in the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), the vessels (vasculitis), or the joints (arthritis or degenerative joint disease). Immune Complex Disease. The nature of the immune complexes may change during the progression of the disease, with resultant changes in the severity of the symptoms. Immune complex formation is dynamic because variations in the ratio of antigen to antibody, the class and subclass of antibody, and the quantity and quality of circulating antigen occur. Thus complexes formed early in a disease process may differ from those formed later, and several types of immune complexes may be present simultaneously. With the tremendous potential heterogeneity of immune complexes, it is not surprising that immune complex diseases are characterized by a variety of symptoms and periods of remission or exacerbation of symptoms. Because many immune complexes activate complement very effectively, complement levels in the blood may decrease during active disease. At times the individual's blood may become hypocomplementemic (i.e., contains below normal amounts of complement activity). During type I, II, or IV hypersensitivity reactions, complement levels are unaffected, or some components of the complement cascade, such as C3, may even be increased. Two prototypic models of type III hypersensitivity help explain the variety of diseases in this category. Serum sickness is a model of systemic type III hypersensitivities, and the Arthus reaction is a model of localized or cutaneous reactions. Serum Sickness. The systemic prototype of immune complex–mediated disease is called serum sickness because it was initially described as being caused by the therapeutic administration of foreign serum, such as horse serum that contained antibody against tetanus toxin.5 Foreign serum generally is not administered to individuals today, although serum sickness reactions can be caused by the repeated intravenous administration of other antigens, such as drugs, and the characteristics of serum sickness are observed in systemic type III autoimmune diseases. Serum sickness–type reactions are caused by the formation of immune complexes in the blood and their subsequent generalized deposition in target tissues. Typically, affected tissues are the blood vessels, joints, and kidneys. Other symptoms include fever, enlarged lymph nodes, rash, and pain at sites of inflammation. A form of serum sickness is Raynaud phenomenon, a condition caused by the temperature-dependent deposition of immune complexes in the capillary beds of the peripheral circulation. Certain immune complexes precipitate at temperatures below normal body temperature, particularly in the tips of the fingers, toes, and nose, and are called cryoglobulins. The precipitates block the circulation and cause localized pallor and numbness, followed by cyanosis (a bluish tinge resulting from oxygen deprivation) and eventually gangrene if the circulation is not restored. Arthus Reaction. An Arthus reaction is the prototypic example of a localized immune complex–mediated inflammatory response.6 It is caused by repeated local exposure to an antigen that reacts with preformed antibody and forms immune complexes in the walls of the local blood vessels. Symptoms of an Arthus reaction begin within 1 hour of exposure and peak 6 to 12 hours later. The lesions are characterized by a typical inflammatory reaction, with increased vascular permeability, an accumulation of neutrophils, edema, hemorrhage, clotting, and tissue damage. Type IV: Cell-Mediated Hypersensitivity Reactions Whereas types I, II, and III hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by antibody, type IV (cell-mediated) hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by T lymphocytes and do not involve antibody (Fig. 9.4). Type IV mechanisms occur through either cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc cells) or lymphokine-producing Th1 and Th17 cells. Tc cells attack and destroy cellular targets directly. Th1 and Th17 cells produce cytokines that recruit and activate phagocytic cells, especially macrophages. Destruction of the tissue is usually caused by direct killing by toxins from Tc cells or by the release of soluble factors, such as lysosomal enzymes and toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), from activated macrophages. FIGURE 9.4 Mechanism of Type IV, Cell-Mediated, Reactions. Antigens from target cells stimulate T cells to differentiate into cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells), which have direct cytotoxic activity, and helper T cells (Th1 cells) involved in delayed hypersensitivity. The Th1 cells produce lymphokines (especially interferon-gamma [IFN-γ]) that activate the macrophage through specific receptors (e.g., IFN-γ receptor [IFNγR]). The macrophages can attach to targets and release enzymes and reactive oxygen species that are responsible for most of the tissue destruction. Clinical examples of type IV hypersensitivity reactions include graft rejection and allergic reactions resulting from contact with such substances as poison ivy and metals. A type IV component also may be present in many autoimmune diseases. For example, T cells against type II collagen (a protein present in joint tissues) contribute to the destruction of joints in rheumatoid arthritis; T cells against a thyroid cell surface antigen contribute to the destruction of the thyroid in autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease); and T cells against an antigen on the surface of pancreatic beta cells (the cell that normally produces insulin) are responsible for beta-cell destruction in insulindependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. A type IV hypersensitivity reaction in the skin was thoroughly described first by Ehrlich in 1891 and led to the development of a diagnostic skin test for tuberculosis.7 The reaction follows an intradermal injection of tuberculin antigen into a suitably sensitized individual and is called a delayed hypersensitivity skin test because of its slow onset—24 to 72 hours to reach maximum intensity. The reaction site is infiltrated with T lymphocytes and macrophages, resulting in a clear hard center (induration) and a reddish surrounding area (erythema). Antigenic Targets of Hypersensitivity Reactions Allergy Allergy is a hypersensitivity response against an environmental antigen (allergen). Allergies are the most common hypersensitivity reactions. The most common allergies are type I hypersensitivities, although any of the other three mechanisms of hypersensitivity may cause allergic responses depending on the particular allergen. Typical allergens that induce type I hypersensitivity include pollens (e.g., ragweed), molds and fungi (e.g., Penicillium notatum), foods (e.g., milk, eggs, shellfish), animals (e.g., cat dander, dog dander), cigarette smoke, components of house dust (e.g., fecal pellets of house mites), and almost anything else encountered in the environment. Allergens that primarily elicit type IV allergic hypersensitivities include plant resins (e.g., poison ivy, poison oak), metals (e.g., nickel, chromium), acetylates, and chemicals in rubber, cosmetics, detergents, and topical antibiotics (e.g., neomycin). Type II and type III allergic hypersensitivities are relatively rare but may include antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, sulfonamides) and soluble antigens produced by infectious agents (e.g., hepatitis B). Usually a sensitization process involving multiple exposures to the allergen occurs before adequate amounts of antibody or T cells are available to elicit a hypersensitivity response. In some instances, exposure to a particular allergen may not be apparent in the case of allergens that are drugs, additives, or preservatives in food. For example, an individual may become sensitized by drinking milk that contains trace amounts of penicillin used for treating cows for mastitis. Thus the first therapeutic exposure to penicillin may cause an unexpected hypersensitivity reaction. Additionally, penicillin shares a β-lactam structure with cephalosporin, so that one antibiotic may be sensitive against another. Genetic Predisposition. Certain individuals are genetically predisposed to develop allergies, particularly type I allergies, and are called atopic. In families in which one parent has an allergy, allergies develop in about 40% of the offspring. If both parents have allergies, the incidence in the offspring may be as high as 80%. (Principles of genetic inheritance are discussed in Chapter 4.) Atopic individuals tend to produce higher quantities of IgE and to have more Fc receptors for IgE on their mast cells. The airways and the skin of atopic individuals are also more responsive to a wide variety of both specific and nonspecific stimuli than are the airways and skin of individuals who are not atopic. Multiple genes have been associated with the atopic state, including polymorphisms in a large variety of cytokines that regulate IgE synthesis (e.g., interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13) and cellular receptors. Clinical Symptoms of Type I Allergies The clinical manifestations of type I reactions are attributable mostly to the biologic effects of histamine. Tissues most commonly affected contain large numbers of mast cells and are sensitive to the effects of histamine released from them. These tissues are found in the gastrointestinal tract, the skin, and the respiratory tract (Fig. 9.5 and Table 9.4). The particular symptoms frequently reflect the main portal of entry for the allergen. For instance, pollens and other airborne allergens usually cause respiratory symptoms. FIGURE 9.5 Type I Hypersensitivity Reactions. Manifestations of allergic reactions as a result of type I hypersensitivity include itching, angioedema (swelling caused by exudation), edema of the larynx, urticaria (hives), bronchospasm (constriction of airways in the lungs), hypotension (low blood pressure), and dysrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) because of anaphylactic shock, and gastrointestinal cramping caused by inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Photographic inserts show a diffuse allergic-like eye and skin reaction on an individual. The skin lesions have raised edges and develop within minutes or hours, with resolution occurring after about 12 hours. (Inserts from Male D et al: Immunology, ed 8, St Louis, 2013, Mosby.)

Modified from Bellanti JA: Immunology III, Philadelphia, 1985, Saunders. Effects of allergens on the mucosa of the eyes, nose, and respiratory tract include conjunctivitis (inflammation of the membranes lining the eyelids), rhinitis (inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose), and asthma (constriction of the bronchi). Symptoms are caused by vasodilation, hypersecretion of mucus, edema, and swelling of the respiratory mucosa. Because the mucous membranes lining the respiratory tract (accessory sinuses, nasopharynx, and upper and lower respiratory tracts) are continuous, they are all adversely affected. The degree to which each is affected determines the symptoms of the disease. Urticaria, or hives, is a dermal (skin) manifestation of type I allergic reactions (see Fig. 9.5). The underlying mechanism is the localized release of histamine and increased vascular permeability, resulting in limited areas of edema. Urticaria is characterized by white fluid-filled blisters (wheals) surrounded by areas of redness (flares). The wheal and flare reaction is usually accompanied by itching. Not all urticarial symptoms are caused by allergic (immunologic) reactions. Some, termed nonimmunologic urticaria, result from exposure to cold temperatures, emotional stress, medications, systemic diseases, hyperthyroidism, or malignancies (e.g., lymphomas). Gastrointestinal allergies are caused primarily by allergens that enter through the mouth—usually foods or medicines. When food is the allergen, the active immunogen may be a product of food breakdown by digestive enzymes. Symptoms usually occur rapidly (frequently within minutes) and include vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain and may be severe enough to result in malabsorption or protein-losing enteropathy, if the reactions are prolonged or recurrent. Systemic symptoms may range from urticaria to lifethreatening anaphylactic reactions. The most common food allergies are milk, chocolate, eggs, soy, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, shellfish, and fish.8 The incidence of food allergies in children is estimated at 2% to 10% and has been increasing. Most children (about 75%) outgrow food allergies, but most individuals with peanut allergy (about 80%) will remain sensitive through adulthood with the potential of severe reactions. If possible, avoidance of the allergen is the best method to limit allergic responses. Approximately 30% of laboratory animal handlers have allergies to animal dander and must use face masks or other devices to avoid contact. Although some type I allergic responses can be controlled by blocking histamine receptors with antihistamines, the primary mechanism of control is the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system includes biochemical mediators (e.g., epinephrine, acetylcholine) that, like the mediators of the inflammatory response, have profound effects on cells. These mediators bind to appropriate receptors on mast cells and the target cells of inflammation (e.g., smooth muscle), thereby controlling (1) the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and (2) the degree to which target cells respond to inflammatory mediators (see Chapter 7). Allergic Disease: Bee Sting Allergy An example of a life-threatening allergy is an anaphylactic reaction to a bee sting. Bee venoms contain a mixture of enzymes and other proteins that may serve as allergens. About 1% of children may have an anaphylactic reaction to bee venom. Within minutes they may develop excessive swelling (edema) at the bee sting site, followed by generalized hives, itching, and swelling in areas distal from the sting (e.g., eyes, lips), and other systemic symptoms including flushing, sweating, dizziness, and headache. The most severe symptoms may include gastrointestinal (e.g., stomach cramps, vomiting), respiratory (e.g., tightness in the throat, wheezing, difficulties breathing), and vascular (e.g., low blood pressure, shock) reactions. Severe respiratory and vascular reactions may lead to death. If a child has had a previous anaphylactic reaction to bee stings, the chance of having another is about 60%. During the reaction the administration of antihistamines has little effect because histamine has already bound H1 receptors and initiated severe bronchial smooth muscle contraction. Most individuals carry self-injectable epinephrine. Autonomic nervous system mediators, such as epinephrine, bind to specific receptors on smooth muscle and reverse the effects of histamine and result in muscle relaxation. Similar anaphylactic reactions have been described against peanuts and other nuts, shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, and some medications. Tests of IgE-Mediated Allergy Allergic reactions can be life threatening; therefore, it is essential that severely allergic individuals be made aware of the specific allergen against which they are sensitized and instructed to avoid contact with that material. Several tests are available, including food challenges, skin tests with allergens, and laboratory tests for measurements of total IgE and allergen-specific IgE in the blood.9 Reactivity to a particular food allergen may be tested by controlled administration of small doses of the suspected allergen in order to evoke a mild allergic response. This approach can be dangerous if the individual has a history of anaphylactic responses. A safer approach is injection of an allergen into (intradermal) or onto (epicutaneous or prick test) the skin. If the individual is allergic to a particular allergen, a local wheal and flare reaction may occur within a few minutes at the site of injection. The diameter of the flare reaction is usually indicative of the individual's degree of sensitivity to that allergen. In the most severely allergic individuals, even the extremely small amounts of allergen used for the skin test may evoke a systemic anaphylaxis. Skin test is also contraindicated if the individual is using medications that may affect the test or has diffuse dermatitis, which would make the reaction difficult to interpret. A variety of laboratory tests can detect IgE antibodies in serum. These assays have various commercial acronyms, depending on whether they are radioimmunoassays (RIAs; reactivity detected by measuring a radioactive reagent) or enzyme immunoassays (EIAs or ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]; reactivity detected by measuring a color change caused by an enzyme-labeled reagent). One set of assays measures circulating levels of total IgE, with atopic individuals usually having elevated levels. Other assays are capable of measuring circulating levels of specific IgE antibodies against selected allergens. The amount of IgE against a specific allergen correlates well with the degree of skin test reactivity and the severity of clinical symptoms related to the same allergen, although the laboratory text is less sensitive. Desensitization. Clinical desensitization to allergens can be achieved in some individuals. Minute quantities of the allergen are injected in increasing doses over a prolonged period. The procedure may reduce the severity of the allergic reaction in the treated individual and works best for routine respiratory tract allergens and biting insect allergies (80% to 90% rate of desensitization over 5 years of treatment). However, this form of therapy is associated with a risk of systemic anaphylaxis, which can be severe and life threatening. Food allergies have been very difficult to suppress, but some promising trials are underway to evaluate desensitization by oral or sublingual administration of increasing amounts of allergen.10 The mechanisms by which desensitization occurs may be several, one of which is the production of large amounts of so-called blocking antibodies, usually circulating IgG. A blocking antibody presumably competes in the tissues or in the circulation for binding with antigenic determinants on the allergen so that the allergen is “neutralized” and is unable to bind with IgE on mast cells. Sublingual desensitization (another approach that works best with some food allergies) produces sIgA and circulating IgG that may prevent the allergen from accessing mast cells. Desensitization injections also may stimulate the generation of clones of T-regulatory lymphocytes, which inhibit hypersensitivity by suppressing the production of IgE or modifying the Th1/Th2 interactions in favor of production of antiinflammatory cytokines. Other approaches to suppressing type I allergic responses have been tested, with some preliminary success. An example is injection of anti-IgE antibody directed against the Fc portion of the IgE in order to decrease binding of IgE to mast cells. Type IV Allergic Hypersensitivities. The allergens that induce a type IV allergic reaction are mostly haptens that react with normal self-proteins in the skin. When presented in this fashion, these antigens are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on antigen-presenting cells in the skin and induce a cell-mediated response. (Pattern recognition receptors are discussed in Chapter 7.) The primary result is an allergic contact dermatitis that is confined to the area of contact with the allergen. The best-known example is poison ivy (Fig. 9.6). The antigen in that instance is a plant catechol, urushiol, that reacts with normal skin proteins and evokes a cell-mediated immune response. FIGURE 9.6 Development of Allergic Contact Dermatitis, a Delayed Hypersensitivity Reaction. A, Shown here is the development of allergy to catechols from poison ivy. No dermatitis results from the primary contact because the antigens (catechols) are sensitizing the immune response and producing memory T cells. Secondary contact, however, quickly activates a type IV, cell-mediated reaction that causes dermatitis. B, This contact dermatitis was caused by a delayed hypersensitivity reaction that led to vesicles and scaling at the sites of contact. (From Damjanov I, Linder J: Anderson's pathology, ed 10, St Louis, 1996, Mosby.) As noted, type I hypersensitivity reactions may result in a skin reaction (e.g., hives formed during an allergic reaction to a particular food). The distribution of the lesions may suggest whether the reaction is caused by immediate (type I) or delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity mechanisms. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, termed atopic dermatitis, are usually characterized by widely distributed lesions, whereas contact dermatitis (delayed hypersensitivity) consists of lesions only at the site of contact with the allergen, such as a metal allergy to jewelry (see Fig. 9.6).11 Types II and III Allergic Hypersensitivities. Type II allergic hypersensitivities are usually against allergic haptens that bind to the surface of cells and elicit an IgG or IgM response. For instance, allergic reactions against many drugs (e.g., penicillin, sulfonamides) occur after the drug binds to proteins on the plasma membranes of a person's cells and becomes immunogenic. The immune system attacks the allergen on the cell membrane and destroys the cell as well. In allergic reactions to penicillin, the immunogenic antigen is a metabolite of penicillin catabolism that binds to the plasma membranes of erythrocytes or platelets and induces an antibody response that destroys the cells (type II hypersensitivity), causing anemia or thrombocytopenia. Type II allergic reactions also can occur against antigens of infectious diseases. For instance, encephalitis secondary to a rubella infection may result from damage to cells of the nervous system by an immune response against rubella virus antigen on the cell's plasma membrane. Type III allergic reactions occur after the formation of immune complexes containing soluble allergens. For instance, Arthus reactions may be observed after injection, ingestion, or inhalation of allergens. Skin reactions can follow subcutaneous or intradermal inoculation with drugs, fungal extracts, or antigens used in skin tests. Gastrointestinal reactions, such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease), follow ingestion of antigen, usually gluten from wheat products (see Chapter 42). Allergic alveolitis is a type III acute hemorrhagic inflammation of the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs resulting from inhalation of fungal antigens, usually particles from moldy hay (farmer's lung) or pigeon feces (pigeon breeder's disease) (see Chapter 36). Circulating drugs (e.g., penicillin) or antigens produced from infectious diseases (e.g., hepatitis B, streptococcal infection) may form circulating immune complexes that are deposited in the circulation (vasculitis) or the kidneys (glomerulonephritis). Autoimmunity Autoimmune diseases originate from the coincidence of an initiating event in a genetically predisposed individual leading to an autoimmune mechanism that affects specific target tissues or cells. Some autoimmune diseases can be familial and attributed to the presence of a very small number of susceptibility genes. Affected family members may not all develop the same disease, but have different disorders characterized by a variety of hypersensitivity reactions, including autoimmune and allergic. For instance, the HLA antigen B27 (HLA is discussed further under Transplantation and Transfusion) is a risk factor for developing ankylosing spondylitis (AS), an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the spine. Ninety-five percent of individuals diagnosed with AS express HLA-B27, whereas only 4% to 8% of the general population expresses this antigen (Table 9.5). Although most autoimmune diseases appear as isolated events without a positive family history, susceptibility for developing such diseases appears to be linked to a combination of multiple genes. TABLE 9.5 EXAMPLES OF ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SPECIFIC HLA ALLELES AND DISEASE DISEASE HLA ALLELE RR Acute anterior uveitis B27 14 Addison disease DR3 6 Ankylosing spondylitis B27 90 Behçet syndrome B51 4 Celiac disease DR3 11 Chronic active hepatitis DR3 13 Dermatitis herpetiformis DR3 16 Diabetes (type 1) DR3 5 DR4 6 DR3/DR4 20 Goodpasture syndrome DR2 16 Graves disease DR3 4 Hashimoto disease DR11 3 Multiple sclerosis DR2 4 Myasthenia gravis DR3 3 Pemphigus vulgaris DR4 13 Postgonococcal arthritis B27 14 Reiter syndrome B27 37 Rheumatoid arthritis DR4 4 Sjögren syndrome DR3 9 Systemic lupus erythematosus DR3 6 HLA, Human leukocyte antigen; RR, the approximate relative risk, which is the frequency of a disease in individuals with the particular HLA allele compared with individuals without that allele. Genetic Factors. Genetic factors that contribute to autoimmunity are easier to identify than the original insult that initiates the disease. It is fairly well established that autoimmune diseases can be familial. Affected family members may not all develop the same disease, but several members may have different disorders characterized by a variety of hypersensitivity reactions, including autoimmune and allergic reactions. Associations with particular autoimmune diseases have been identified for a variety of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles (see Chapter 8) or non-MHC genes. The specific HLA alleles of susceptible and resistant individuals have been analyzed for almost every known disease and, almost universally, individuals with certain diseases are more likely than the general population to have a specific HLA allele or set of alleles.12 Some associations are strong; others are more tenuous (see Table 9.5). The reason some HLA alleles are associated with inappropriate immune function is unclear, but it may directly involve the ability of particular HLA molecules to present antigen or the use of particular HLAs as receptors for disease-causing microorganisms. These genes may determine an individual's susceptibility to specific infectious agents or the capacity of that individual to mount an immune response against specific antigens. Therefore, an individual of a specific HLA type may have an inappropriate or exaggerated immune responses against a microorganism resulting in a hypersensitivity reaction. A large variety of non-MHC genes also have been identified as risk factors for the development of specific autoimmune diseases. Most of these genes encode for inflammatory cytokines or costimulatory molecules found on the cell surface. Breakdown of Tolerance. Individuals are usually tolerant to their own antigens. Tolerance is a state of immunologic control so that the individuals do not make a detrimental immune response against their own cells and tissues. Central tolerance develops in humans during the embryonic period as autoreactive lymphocytes are either eliminated or suppressed in the primary lymphoid organs during differentiation and proliferation of immature T or B lymphocytes (see Figs. 8.9 and 8.12). Clones of cells with antigen receptors for self-antigens are deleted. Peripheral tolerance is maintained in the secondary lymphoid organs through the action of T-regulatory lymphocytes or antigen-presenting dendritic cells. The key term in the definition of tolerance is detrimental immune response because autoimmune antibodies frequently are present at low, but measurable, levels in the blood of most individuals. They may perform a useful function, such as removing low levels of cellular debris from the blood, and are quantitatively and qualitatively regulated to avoid autoimmune disease. Autoimmune disease results more commonly from a breakdown of this peripheral tolerance rather than a defect in central tolerance. An initiating event results in a breakdown of tolerance to an individual's own antigens. A great deal of research has progressively identified genetic risk or predisposing factors in autoimmune diseases, but, in the vast majority of autoimmune diseases, the nature of the initiating event and the mechanism by which it breaks tolerance are unclear. Several potential mechanisms have been suggested. Sequestered Antigen. The induction of central tolerance requires that the self-antigen be present in the fetus and exposed to the developing fetal immune system. Some self-antigens may not normally encounter the immune system in either fetal or adult life, but are sequestered or hidden from the immune system in immunologically privileged sites, so named because foreign tissues can be transplanted into these sites with less chance of immunologic rejection. For example, several sites (e.g., anterior chamber of the eye, the brain) are separated from the circulation by barriers (blood-ocular and blood-brain barriers) that offer protection against many immune cells and lead to relatively poor lymphatic drainage. Lymphocytes that enter these sites encounter tissue that expresses Fas ligand (FasL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). These molecules induce the lymphocytes to undergo apoptosis, thus protecting the tissue. Self-antigens in these sites are protected by sequestration and an active protective mechanism. However, if the barriers are damaged, antigenic sensitization can occur, and the resultant antibodies and lymphocytes can enter the site and cause additional damage to the tissue. For instance, physical trauma to one eye may result in release of sequestered antigen into the blood or lymphatics, resulting in immunologic injury to the other eye (sympathetic uveitis).13 Infectious Disease. A long-standing hypothesis is that foreign antigens from infectious microorganisms can initiate autoimmune disease through a process of molecular mimicry. Some antigens of infectious agents so closely resemble (mimic) a particular self-antigen that antibodies or T cells produced to protect against the infection also recognize the selfantigen as foreign (cross-reactive antibody or T cell). The relationship between many autoimmune diseases and predisposing infections, such as the link between enterovirus infection and type 1 diabetes, and the link between a variety of infectious microorganisms and autoimmune thyroid disease are being investigated.14,15 The only clearly defined example so far is acute rheumatic fever that may occur after a group A streptococcal sore throat.16 In some individuals with group A streptococcal sore throat or infection of the skin or mucosa, the M protein and group A carbohydrate in the bacterial capsule mimic (antigenic mimicry) normal antigens in the heart valves and induce antibodies that also react with proteins (e.g., cardiac myosin and others) in the heart valve, damaging the valve, and allowing the influx of CD4+ cells with specificities towards normal valvular antigens. Only a small number of individuals whose heart proteins have similar antigens to the bacterial capsular antigens are normally affected. Thus acute rheumatic fever is initiated by a type II autoimmune hypersensitivity that may be augmented by a type IV hypersensitivity. Additionally, some streptococcal infections also release soluble bacterial antigens into the blood that form circulating immune complexes with antibacterial antigens. The complexes may deposit in the kidneys and initiate an immune complex–mediated glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney). Thus soluble streptococcal antigens may, by a type III hypersensitivity mechanism, elicit a poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Because the circulating antigens are bacterial and thus environmental, this complication may be defined as a type III allergic reaction. Neoantigen. In certain situations, a neoantigen that induces an allergic reaction may also lead to autoimmunity. Many neoantigens (new antigens) are haptens that become immunogenic after binding to self-proteins. The immune reaction against the neoantigen may lead to an immunologic reaction against normal antigenic determinants on the protein. Other new antigenic determinants may result from posttranslational modifications of a normal protein so that one or more amino acids are chemically altered (e.g., addition or removal of amino acid side groups, phosphorylation) without affecting the protein's function. Many experimental autoimmune diseases (e.g., experimental autoimmune thyroiditis) can be initiated by immunization with molecules containing neoantigenic determinants. Neoantigens may result from genetic or epigenetic modifications or posttranslational modification, particularly in response to lifestyle (e.g., smoking, diet, consumption of alcohol or coffee, exposure to organic solvents). These conditions are under investigation, but to date only associations rather than clear causative relationships have been found.17 Forbidden Clone. During differentiation and proliferation of lymphoid stem cells into immature T and B lymphocytes (see Figs. 8.9 and 8.12), some lymphocytes produce receptors that react with self-antigens. Many autoreactive lymphocytes interact with self-antigens and other costimulatory molecules on the surface of thymic epithelial cells and are induced to undergo clonal deletion by a process of apoptosis. Thus lymphocytes reactive against self-antigen are prevented, or “forbidden,” from maturing. Autoimmunity may result from the survival of a forbidden clone and its proliferation later in life. Defective Peripheral Tolerance. Tolerance to some self-antigens is controlled in the secondary lymphoid organs. This process is controlled by a variety of cells, including antigen-presenting dendritic cells and members of a family of T-regulatory lymphocytes (Treg cells) that normally suppress immune responses against self. Defects in particular regulatory cells may result in expansion of clones of autoreactive cells and the development of autoimmune disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus, which is characterized by the production of a large array of autoantibodies, may be caused by a general breakdown in the regulatory network. Silent Imitators of Autoimmune Disease. The mechanism for imitation of autoimmune diseases may already be within all humans. Two very interesting potential mechanisms are being explored (see What's New? Silent Initiators of Autoimmune Disease: Microchimerism and Endogenous Retroviruses). What's New? Silent Initiators of Autoimmune Disease: Microchimerism and Endogenous Retroviruses Two normally silent conditions have been studied in relationship to the onset of autoimmune diseases. Both microchimerism and endogenous retroviruses are conditions that have unknown roles in normal physiology, but may be triggers for autoimmune diseases. A rapidly growing body of evidence suggests that humans are in a state of microchimerism (Mc): possessing a small number of cells originating from another individual.1 The placenta routinely allows bidirectional passage of both maternal and fetal cells beginning as early as 6 months' gestation. Most gravid women (having been pregnant) have detectable fetal cells (fetal Mc) in their blood and many organs (e.g., white blood cells, hepatocytes, kidney tubular epithelium, neurons and glia, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, intestinal epithelium, and islet beta cells), which apparently originated as fetal stem cells that differentiated in the maternal tissues. Microchimerism persists for decades after pregnancy. The fetal cells appear to be regulated by T-cell cytokines: TGF-β and IL-10.2 If regulation is diminished, the fetal cells may initiate a chronic inflammatory reaction leading to tissue damage and potential autoimmune reactions. Many autoimmune diseases are associated with increased numbers of male cells in the diseased organs (e.g., scleroderma, dermatomyositis, Sjögren syndrome, thyroiditis, primary biliary cirrhosis, hyper- and hypothyroidism, and systemic lupus erythematosus), suggesting that Mc may contribute to the etiology of these diseases.1 The role of microchimerism in autoimmune thyroid disease is enveloped in contradictory data. Levels of fetal cells are elevated in the blood in women with autoimmune thyroid diseases: Graves and Hashimoto disease,3 whereas others have reported fewer fetal cells associated with these diseases.4 Thus it cannot yet be determined whether the foreign cells are initiators of autoimmune damage. Thus these observations remain intriguing but of unknown significance. Another silent potential trigger of autoimmune disease is activation of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). Infectious retroviruses, such as HIV, are well-known. What most do not know is that 8% of the human genome is of retroviral origin. It appears that 30 to 40 million years ago, humans were infected by simple retroviruses that inserted themselves into the genome of gametes, thus becoming inheritable.5 The endogenous retroviral inserts contained regions of control of expression, the gag gene that encoded matrix and capsid proteins (Gag proteins), the pol region that encoded retroviral enzymes, and the env gene for envelope (Env) proteins. Most HERV genes are inactivated. The genome contains approximately 10,000 retroviral sequences, but only about 50 functional open reading frames so that several Gag, Pol, and Env proteins can be expressed. These genes are usually silent until activated for unknown reasons. Several HERV genes are activated and expressed in tissues undergoing autoimmune processes. They have been described in tissue related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, and Sjögren syndrome. An unresolved hypothesis is that some HERV proteins mimic normal proteins, inducing autoantibodies that attack normal proteins, and triggering autoimmune inflammation.6 Gag proteins are expressed by HERV K-10 and the Fc region of IgG1, which also is the target for rheumatoid factor, a pathologic autoantibody associated with RA. Several HERVs, especially HRES1 Gag protein, are activated during SLE. HRES-1 Gag has homology with at least nine autoantigens that are common targets in SLE. Two HERV loci (HERV-Fc1 on the X chromosome and HERV-K13 on chromosome 19) appear to synergize and increase the risk for Mc.7 References: 1. Nelson JL. Trends Immunol. 2012;33(8):421–427. 2.

Alloimmunity Alloimmunity occurs when an individual's immune system reacts against antigens on the tissues of other members of the same species. Genetic diversity is the norm in humans. Diversity also is observed among self-antigens, so that two individuals may have different antigens on their tissues and, therefore, make an immune response against each other's tissues. Some self-antigens, such as the ABO blood group, have limited diversity with very few different antigens being expressed in the population, whereas others, such as the HLA system, have tremendous diversity. Two clinically relevant examples of this reactivity are (1) several transient neonatal diseases (in which the maternal immune system becomes sensitized against antigens expressed by the fetus) and (2) transplant rejection and transfusion reactions (in which the immune system of a recipient of an organ transplant or blood transfusion reacts against antigens on the donor cells). Transient Neonatal Alloimmunity. Because the fetus is a hybrid between the mother and father, it expresses paternal antigens that are not found in the mother. Occasionally these fetal antigens cross the placenta and elicit an immune response in the mother (e.g., production of alloantibodies against the fetal antigens). The maternal alloantibody may be transported across the placenta into the fetal circulation, bind to the fetal cells, and produce alloimmune disease in the fetus and neonate. The mother's immune system produces the antibody, but because the cells do not express the target antigen, the mother has no symptoms of the disease. Neonatal alloimmune disease may be secondary to maternal autoimmune diseases in which the mother produces an IgG autoantibody specific for maternal self-antigens that are found on fetal cells as well. Therefore, symptoms of the same autoimmune disease may affect mother and child, even though the autoantibody is being produced only by the mother's immune system. This form of disease usually occurs only in association with type II (tissue-specific) hypersensitivity reactions. It does not occur in association with IgEmediated (type I) reactions, immune complex–mediated (type III) reactions, or cell-mediated (type IV) reactions because the immunologic factors (IgE, immune complexes, T cells) that cause these reactions do not readily cross the placenta and enter the fetal circulation in sufficient quantity. Symptoms of the alloimmune disease may be present in utero or immediately after birth and may be fatal to the fetus or neonate. At birth, maternal circulating antibody can no longer enter the child, and if symptoms are successfully treated, the disease will disappear as the maternal antibody is catabolized.18 Examples of maternal immunologic hypersensitivity diseases in which the child can be affected include the following antibody-mediated diseases: 1. Graves disease—an autoimmune disease in which maternal antibody against the receptor for TSH causes neonatal hyperthyroidism 2. Myasthenia gravis—an autoimmune disease in which maternal antibody binds with receptors for neural transmitters on muscle cells (acetylcholine receptors), causing neonatal muscular weakness (see Chapter 18) 3. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura—a disease in which both autoimmune and alloimmune variants in maternal antiplatelet antibody destroy platelets in the fetus and neonate (see Chapter 30) 4. Alloimmune neutropenia—a disease in which maternal antibody against neutrophils destroys neutrophils in the neonate 5. Systemic lupus erythematosus—an autoimmune disease in which diverse maternal autoantibodies induce anomalies (e.g., congenital heart defects) in the fetus or cause pregnancy loss 6. Rh and ABO alloimmunization (e.g., erythroblastosis fetalis)— a disease in which maternal antibody against erythrocyte antigens induces anemia in the child (see Chapter 31) Autoimmune and Alloimmune Diseases Many examples of autoimmune or alloimmune diseases have been described. Several basic principles are exemplified by two examples: systemic lupus erythematosus (an autoimmune disease) and tissue rejection (i.e., transplant rejection or transfusion reaction) (an alloimmune phenomenon). Most of the classic autoimmune diseases, including disorders of the endocrine system (autoimmune thyroiditis and Graves disease), hematologic system (the hemolytic and pernicious anemias), nervous system (myasthenia gravis), and connective tissue in joints (rheumatoid arthritis), are discussed in Unit II of this book. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory disease and is one of the most common, complex, and serious of the autoimmune disorders. SLE is characterized by multiple immune disorders that result in the production of a large variety of autoantibodies against nucleic acids, erythrocytes, coagulation proteins, phospholipids, lymphocytes, platelets, and many other selfcomponents.19 The most characteristic autoantibodies produced in SLE are against nucleic acids (e.g., single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], double-stranded DNA), histones, ribonucleoproteins, and other nuclear materials. Deposition of circulating immune complexes containing antibody against DNA produces tissue damage in individuals with SLE. DNA and DNA-containing immune complexes have a high affinity for glomerular basement membranes and therefore may be selectively deposited in the glomerulus (Fig. 9.7). (Kidney structures are described in Chapter 38.) The presence of DNA in the circulation increases from cellular damage in response to trauma, drugs, or infections and is usually removed in the liver. Removal of circulating DNA is slowed in the presence of immune complexes, thereby increasing the potential for deposition in the kidney. (The liver's role in removing waste products from the blood is discussed in Chapter 41.) Deposition of immune complexes composed of DNA and antibody also causes inflammatory lesions in the renal tubular basement membranes, brain (choroid plexus), heart, spleen, lung, gastrointestinal tract, skin (see Fig. 9.7), and peritoneum. FIGURE 9.7 Deposition of IgG in the Kidney and Skin of Individuals With Lupus. These photographs of tissue were obtained from individuals with lupus and stained with fluorescent anti-IgG.

(A courtesy Dr. Helmut Rennke, Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston; B courtesy Dr. Richard Sontheimer, Department of Dermatology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas.) SLE, as with most autoimmune diseases, occurs more often in women (approximately a 10 : 1 predominance of females), especially in the 20- to 40-year-old age group. Blacks are affected more often than whites (about an eightfold increased risk). A genetic predisposition for the disease has been implicated on the basis of increased incidence in twins and the existence of autoimmune disease in the families of individuals with SLE. A transient lupus-like syndrome that is indistinguishable both clinically and in the laboratory from spontaneously occurring SLE can develop from the prolonged use of medications, particularly hydralazine (an antihypertensive agent) and procainamide (an antidysrhythmic drug). In genetically susceptible individuals, certain environmental agents, such as ultraviolet light, and several infectious agents may trigger lupus-like immune reactions. Clinical manifestations of SLE include arthralgias or arthritis (90% of individuals), vasculitis and rash (70% to 80% of individuals), renal disease (40% to 50% of individuals), hematologic abnormalities (50% of individuals, with anemia being the most common complication), and cardiovascular diseases (30% to 50% of individuals). A recent study of male and female individuals with SLE reported gender-based differences in the incidence of SLE-related symptoms.20 Females more commonly developed alopecia, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, malar rash, lupus anticoagulant, arthritis, and serositis with pleurisy, whereas males more commonly developed thrombocytopenia, antidsDNA, and renal involvement. As with most autoimmune diseases, the disease process develops slowly (up to 10 years from occurrence of the first autoantibody until diagnosis)21 and is characterized by frequent remissions and exacerbations. Because the signs and symptoms affect almost every body system and tend to be intermittent, SLE is extremely difficult to diagnose. This has led to the development of a list of 11 common clinical findings,22 which has been modified slightly to increase sensitivity of the diagnosis.23 The serial or simultaneous presence of at least four of them indicates that the individual has SLE:24 1. Facial rash confined to the cheeks (malar rash) 2. Discoid rash (raised patches, scaling) 3. Photosensitivity (development of skin rash developed as a result of exposure to sunlight) 4. Oral or nasopharyngeal ulcers 5. Nonerosive arthritis of at least two peripheral joints 6. Serositis (pleurisy, pericarditis) 7. Renal disorder (persistent proteinuria of >0.5 g/day or >3 g/day on dipstick or cellular casts) 8. Neurologic disorders (seizures or psychosis in the absence of known causes) 9. Hematologic disorders (hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, or thrombocytopenia) 10. Immunologic disorders (antibodies against double-stranded DNA [dsDNA] or Smith [Sm] antigen, false-positive serologic test for syphilis, or antiphospholipid antibodies [anticardiolipin antibody or lupus anticoagulant]) 11. Presence of antinuclear antibody (ANA) Laboratory diagnosis is usually based on a positive ANA screening test; about 98% of persons with SLE are positive, but a substantial number of false-positives occur in healthy individuals and those with other diseases. Because SLE is a progressive and slowly developing disease, some laboratory tests, including the ANA, may be positive years before the onset of clinical symptoms.25 Detection of a positive ANA is usually followed by one or more specific tests (e.g., antibodies against Sm, dsDNA) that are complicated by low sensitivity (only a portion of individuals with SLE will be positive, although the number of false-positives is low). There is no cure for SLE or most other autoimmune diseases. In the 1950s, the expected survival rate at 5 years after diagnosis was only 50%. Because of improved diagnosis and treatment of SLE the 2004 expected survival rate 20 years after diagnosis was 78%.26 Fatalities resulting from SLE are usually related to cardiovascular disease with infection and other organ failure almost as common. The goals of treatment are to control symptoms and prevent further damage by suppressing the autoimmune response. Mild forms of SLE are treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen, to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Low-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are often prescribed with higher doses used for more serious active disease. Antimalarial medications (e.g., hydroxychloroquine) are preferred treatments for individuals with stable disease. Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide) are used to treat individuals with severe symptoms involving internal organs who have not responded to high-dose corticosteroids. Ultraviolet light can worsen symptoms (known as flares), and protection from sun exposure is helpful. Prolonged use of certain drugs can cause transient SLE-like symptoms, and the medication history is important for diagnostic evaluation. Other therapeutic approaches have been attempted for SLE and other autoimmune diseases. Several decades ago preparations of intravenous immune globulin (IVIg), which was routinely used to replenish antibodies in persons with antibody deficiencies, were administered to children with autoimmune thrombocytopenia (an autoimmune disease in which platelets were destroyed by an autoantibody). IVIg therapy resulted in a rebound of platelet levels and temporary resolution of the thrombocytopenia. IVIg is currently being used for a variety of autoimmune diseases, including SLE. A monoclonal antibody, belimumab, inhibits a factor that activates B cells and has been used in some individuals with SLE. Other reagents have specifically targeted and suppressed B and T cells that are participating in autoimmune responses.27 This approach has been somewhat successful in SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases. Improved outcomes may be available in the future with the continued advances in medical research and the use of stem cell treatments. Transfusion Reactions Red blood cells (erythrocytes) express several important surface antigens, known collectively as the blood group antigens, that can be targets of alloimmune reactions. More than 80 different red cell antigens are grouped into several dozen blood group systems. The most important of these, because they provoke the strongest humoral alloimmune response, are the ABO and Rh systems. ABO System. Human blood transfusions were carried out as early as 1818, but they were often unsuccessful. Sometimes after a transfusion, the recipient's red blood cells would clump together, thereby blocking the capillaries and causing death in some instances. In 1901 Karl Landsteiner reported that this reaction was related to the ABO antigens located on the surface of erythrocytes. The ABO blood group consists of two major carbohydrate antigens, labeled A and B (Fig. 9.8), that are expressed on virtually all cells. These are codominant so that both A and B can be simultaneously expressed, resulting in an individual having any one of four different blood types. The erythrocytes of persons with blood type A express the type A carbohydrate antigen (i.e., carry the A antigen), those with blood type B express the B antigen, those with blood type AB express both A and B antigens on the same cell, and those of blood type O express neither the A nor the B antigen. A person with type A blood also has circulating antibodies to the B carbohydrate antigen. If this person receives blood containing B antigens (i.e., blood from a type AB or B individual), a severe transfusion reaction occurs and the transfused erythrocytes are destroyed by agglutination (Fig. 9.9) or complement-mediated lysis. Similarly, a type B individual (whose blood contains anti-A antibodies) cannot receive blood from a type A or type AB donor. Type O individuals, who have neither A nor B antigen but have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies, cannot accept blood from any of the other three types. These naturally occurring antibodies, called isohemagglutinins, are IgM and are induced early in life by similar antigens expressed on naturally occurring bacteria in the intestinal tract.28 FIGURE 9.8 ABO Blood Types. This figure shows the antigens and antibodies associated with the ABO blood groups. The surfaces of erythrocytes of individuals with blood group O have the core H antigenic carbohydrate. Their sera contain IgM antibodies against both A and B carbohydrates. In individuals of the blood group A, some of the H antigens have been modified into A antigens by the addition of Nacetylgalactosamine (NAGA). The sera of these individuals have IgM antibodies against the B antigen. In individuals with blood group B, some of the H antigens have been modified into B antigens by the addition of galactose (Gal). These individuals have IgM antibodies against the A antigen in their sera. In individuals of the blood group AB, some of the H antigens have been modified into both the A and the B antigens. These individuals do not have antibody to either A or B antigens. Fuc, Fucose. FIGURE 9.9 Mismatched Transfused Blood Cells. Agglutination of erythrocytes caused by anti-A blood-typing serum. (Copyright Ed Reschke.) Because individuals with type O blood lack both types of antigens, they are considered universal donors, meaning that anyone can accept their red blood cells. Similarly, type AB individuals are considered universal recipients because they lack both anti-A and anti-B antibodies and can be transfused with any ABO blood type. When large volumes of whole blood (i.e., cells plus plasma) are transfused, however, antibodies in the donor's blood can bind to antigenic determinants on the recipient's erythrocytes, causing agglutination of the recipient's own cells. Preparations of pooled immunoglobulins are routinely administered intravenously (IVIg) to treat those who have immune deficiencies lacking antibodies (discussed later in this chapter). Transfusion reactions can occur if the IVIg contains excess levels of isohemagglutinins against the recipient's A or B antigens.29 Harmful transfusion reactions can be prevented only by complete and careful ABO matching between donor and recipient.30 Because ABO antigens are also expressed on all other cells, except platelets, ABO typing and matching also must be performed before organ transplantation. Rh System. The Rh blood group is a group of antigens expressed only on red blood cells. This group is the most polymorphic system of red cell antigens, consisting of at least 50 separate antigens. At least five major antigens and a large number of rare variants have been identified and are expressed primarily on erythrocytes. The major antigens are contained on two proteins encoded from two closely linked genes, RHD and RHCE. The RhD protein expresses the dominant antigen, which determines whether an individual is Rh-positive or Rhnegative. Individuals who express the D antigen on the RhD protein are Rh-positive, whereas individuals who do not express the D antigen are Rh-negative. The letter d is used to indicate lack of D. Rhpositive individuals can have either a DD or a Dd genotype, whereas Rh-negative individuals have the dd genotype. About 15% of North American whites are Rh-negative, whereas the Rh-negative genotype is much less common among members of other ethnic groups. Rhnegative individuals can make anti-D if exposed to Rh-positive erythrocytes, but because the letter d is used to indicate the lack of the D antigen and does not represent a different antigen, Rh-positive individuals do not produce an antibody against d. The second protein, RhCE, expresses two different antigens, C and E, each of which has two different alleles (C or c, E or e). Therefore, four potential haplotypes of C and E antigens are commonly observed: CE, Ce, cE, and ce. A disease called hemolytic disease of the newborn was most commonly caused by IgG anti-D alloantibody produced by Rhnegative mothers against erythrocytes of their Rh-positive fetuses (see Chapter 31).31 The mother's antibody crossed the placenta and destroyed the red blood cells of the fetus. The occurrence of this particular form of the disease has decreased dramatically because of the use of prophylactic IgG anti-D immunoglobulin (e.g., Rho[D] immunoglobulin).32 By mechanisms that are still not completely understood, administration of anti-D antibody within a few days of exposure to RhD-positive erythrocytes completely prevents sensitization against the D antigen. Because hemolytic disease of the newborn related to the D antigen has been controlled, alloantibodies against the other Rh antigens (usually C, c, or E) have become more important. In general, these alloantibodies are associated with a less severe hemolytic disease. A form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia is often caused by autoantibodies against Rh antigens, especially the e antigen.33 This variant is caused by IgG antibodies that react with erythrocytes at normal body temperature (thus called warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia) and increase phagocytic destruction of the red blood cell. This characteristic differentiates the warm variant from another form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is caused by IgM autoantibodies that react optimally with erythrocytes in the cooler portions of the body (e.g., fingers, toes) and is referred to as cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Graft Rejection Molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) were discussed in Chapter 8 as antigen-presenting molecules. MHC molecules also are a major target of transplant rejection. As a result of studies of transplantation, the human MHC molecules are also referred to as human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), and the different MHC genetic loci are commonly called HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP. Additional genes for complement components (e.g., C4, factor B) also are contained in the MHC region and are referred to as class III loci. The class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) and class II MHC loci (HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP) are the most genetically diverse (polymorphic) of any human genetic loci. Within the human population, the number of possible different alleles (i.e., forms of the gene) expressed by each locus is astounding. For example, more than 300 different HLA-A molecules are expressed in the population. These numbers are based on the polymorphism of observed DNA sequences and may not reflect differences in function. Clearly, not every allele is expressed in the same individual. Humans have two copies of each MHC locus (one inherited from each parent) that are codominant so that molecules encoded by each parent's genes are expressed on the surface of every cell, except erythrocytes. Within an individual, each locus will express only one allele. For instance, each person will have at most two different HLAA proteins (one from each parent). The specific combination of alleles at the six major HLA loci on one chromosome (A, B, C, DR, DQ, and DP) is termed a haplotype. Each individual has two HLA haplotypes, one from the paternal chromosome 6 and another from the maternal chromosome. Odds dictate that children will share one haplotype with half their siblings and either no haplotypes or both haplotypes with a quarter of their siblings. Thus the chance of finding a match among siblings is 25%. Because of the tremendous number of possible alleles expressed throughout the population, the probability of matching any two unrelated individuals is extremely small. Not all HLA loci are equally important; matching at the HLA-DR locus appears to be the most critical for graft acceptance, and matching at HLA-A and HLA-B of slightly lesser importance. (These loci also are discussed in Chapter 8.) Transplant rejection may be classified as hyperacute, acute, or chronic, depending on the amount of time that elapses between transplantation and rejection. Hyperacute rejection is immediate and rare. When the circulation is reestablished to the grafted area, the graft may immediately turn white (the so-called white graft) instead of a normal pink. Hyperacute rejection usually occurs in recipients with preexisting antibody (type II reaction) to HLA antigens on vascular endothelium in the graft. The antibodies may have resulted from rejection of a previous graft or from prior blood transfusions that contained platelets and white blood cells with foreign HLA. Additionally, about half of women who have had multiple pregnancies have circulating antibodies against their husband's HLA antigens. As the circulation to the graft is established, antibodies bind to the vascular endothelial cells in the grafted tissue and activate the inflammatory response, including the coagulation cascade, which results in stasis of blood flow into the tissue (see Fig. E 9.1 on Evolve). (Coagulation is described in Chapters 7 and 28.) Biopsies of the graft often show deposits of antibody (IgG and IgM), complement, and neutrophils. This condition is rare because of effective pretransplantation cross-matching during which a recipient is tested for antibodies against the HLA antigens of the potential donor. Acute rejection is primarily a cell-mediated immune response that occurs within days to months after transplantation. This type of rejection occurs when the recipient develops an immune response against unmatched HLAs after transplantation. Sensitization is usually initiated by the recipient's lymphocytes interacting with the donor's dendritic cells within the transplanted tissue, resulting in induction of recipient Th1 and Tc cells against the donor's antigens. The Th1 cells release cytokines that activate infiltrating macrophages, and the Tc cells directly attack the endothelial cells in the transplanted tissue. A biopsy of the rejected organ usually shows an infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages characteristic of a type IV reaction. Immunosuppressive drugs may delay or lessen the intensity of acute rejection. Another form of acute rejection, acute antibody-mediated rejection, has recently been recognized and accounts for about 10% of acute rejections. This form of rejection is mediated by antibody and complement. The predominant antibodies are against HLA antigens or, on occasion, autoantigens in the graft (e.g., vimentin, angiotensin receptor), but, unlike those antibodies that cause hyperacute rejection, are not present at the time of transplantation. Sensitization takes 2 weeks or longer and results in the accumulation of antibody, complement, neutrophils, and thrombi in the vasculature of the graft (a type II hypersensitivity reaction). Chronic rejection may occur after a period of months or years of normal function. It is characterized by slow, progressive organ failure. Chronic rejection usually results from a weak cell-mediated immunologic (type IV) reaction against minor histocompatibility antigens on the grafted tissue. However, antibodies against HLA and other antigens also may cause chronic rejection through activation of complement or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with NK cells. Deficiencies in Immunity Disorders resulting from immune deficiency are the clinical sequelae (results) of impaired function of one or more components of the immune or inflammatory response (e.g., B cells, T cells, phagocytes, complement) (Table 9.6). An immune deficiency is the failure of these mechanisms of self-defense to function at their normal capacity, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections. A primary (congenital) immune deficiency is caused generally by a genetic anomaly, whereas a secondary (acquired) immune deficiency is caused by another illness, such as cancer or viral infection, or by normal physiologic changes, such as aging. Acquired forms of immune deficiency are far more common than the congenital forms.

Initial Clinical Presentation The clinical hallmark of immune deficiency is a tendency to develop unusual or recurrent, severe infections. The most severe primary immune deficiencies develop in young children 2 years old and younger. Frequent infections are normal in preschool and school-age children, who normally have 6 to 12 infections per year, of which 3 or 4 are ear infections, and adults may have 2 to 4 infections per year. Most of these are not severe and are limited to viral infections of the upper respiratory tract, recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, or mild otitis media. Potential immune deficiencies are considered if the individual has had severe, documented bouts of pneumonia, severe otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, septicemia, or meningitis or infections with rare opportunistic microorganisms that normally are not pathogenic or usually confined to one site (e.g., Pneumocystis jirovecii, disseminated Candida infection, cytomegalovirus [CMV]). Infections are generally recurrent with only short intervals of relative health, and multiple simultaneous infections are common. Individuals with primary immune deficiencies often have eight or more purulent ear infections, two or more serious sinus infections, and two or more pneumonias, recurrent abscesses or infections in unusual sites, or persistent fungal infections (particularly thrush in a child at least 1 year old) within a year. Invasive fungal infections are rare in healthy individuals and strongly indicate a defective immune system. Recurrent internal infections, such as meningitis, osteomyelitis, or sepsis, are common. Prolonged antibiotic use is commonly ineffective by oral or injected routes and may necessitate intravenous administration. Children frequently present with failure to thrive because of chronic diarrhea and other chronic symptoms. A familial history of immune deficiency may be found in some types of primary deficiency. Routine care of individuals with immune deficiencies must be tempered with the knowledge that the immune system may be totally ineffective. It is unsafe to administer conventional immunizing agents or blood products to many of these individuals because of the risk of causing an uncontrolled infection. Infection is a particular problem when attenuated vaccines that contain live but weakened microorganisms are used (e.g., live polio vaccine; vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella). The type of recurrent infections that manifest may indicate the type of immune defect. Deficiencies in T-cell immune responses associated with recurrent infections are caused by certain viruses (e.g., varicella, vaccinia, herpes, cytomegalovirus), fungi and yeasts (e.g., Candida, Histoplasma), or certain atypical microorganisms (e.g., P. jirovecii). Bcell deficiencies and phagocyte deficiencies, however, are suggested if the individual has documented, recurrent infections with microorganisms that require opsonization (e.g., encapsulated bacteria) or viruses against which humoral immunity is normally effective (e.g., rubella). Some complement deficiencies resemble defects in antibody or phagocyte function, but others are characterized by disseminated infections with bacteria of the genus Neisseria (Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Much of the current understanding of the development of the immune system and the interactions of the cells in the immune response was developed by studying congenital and acquired immune deficiencies or, as they have been called, “experiments of nature.” Many immune deficiencies result from selective alteration or removal of one component of the immune system. The importance of that component can be understood by observing the effect of its removal on the remainder of the immune response. Primary Immune Deficiencies Most primary immune deficiencies are the result of single gene defects (Fig. 9.10). Generally, the mutations are sporadic and not inherited: a family history exists in only about 25% of individuals. The sporadic mutations occur before birth, but the onset of symptoms may be early in neonatal life or later, depending on the particular syndrome. In approximately 60% of the cases, symptoms of immune deficiency appear within the first 2 years of life, whereas other immune deficiencies are progressive, with the onset of symptoms appearing in the second or third decade of life. The most common symptoms include sinusitis (68% of individuals), pneumonia (51%), ear infections (51%), diarrhea (30%), and bronchitis (55%), with the incidence varying depending on the specific syndrome. FIGURE 9.10 Lymphocyte Development Defects. This diagram shows defects in lymphocyte development that may account for congenital (primary) immune deficiencies. See the text and refer to Figs. 8.9 and 8.12 for more detailed information. Pluripotent stem cell indicates the common stem cells for lymphocytic, granulocytic, and monocytic lineages. Cytokine receptor defects include X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (IL-2 receptor defect), JAK3 defects, and IL-7 receptor defects. T-cell receptor (TCR) defects include defects in CD3, CD45, and ZAP-70. Neither common variable immune deficiency nor chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is included in this figure because the cause of these defects remains unknown. See Table 9.6 for further information on each defect. ADA, Adenosine deaminase deficiency; agamma, agammaglobulinemia; AICD deficiency, activation-induced cytidine deaminase deficiency; AT, ataxia-telangiectasia; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency; RAG, recombination-activating enzyme; sIgM and sIgD, surface IgM and IgD, respectively; WAS, WiskottAldrich syndrome. Individually, primary immune deficiencies are very rare. For instance, only 30 to 50 new cases of severe combined immune deficiency are diagnosed in the United States yearly. However, more than 200 different genetic defects resulting in immune deficiencies have been identified, and the number is growing rapidly. Together, primary immune deficiencies are more common than cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, childhood leukemia, or many other well-known diseases. Many are subtle with minor deficiencies, but several lead to recurrent life-threatening infections. An estimated 50,000 cases of clinically significant primary immune deficiency have been reported in the United States. The gender distribution depends on the specific disease, but in general those diagnosed within the first 2 years of life have a male preponderance (5 : 1) because many are X-linked, whereas those diagnosed later are evenly distributed. The three most commonly diagnosed deficiencies are common variable immune deficiency (34% of individuals with primary immune deficiencies), selective IgA deficiency (24%), and IgG subclass deficiency (17%). Primary immune deficiencies have recently been reclassified into nine groups, based on which principal component of the immune or inflammatory systems is defective.34 On occasion a particular immune deficiency may be listed under two categories because the predominant mechanism may not be fully understood. To provide a better understanding of the diversity and severity of primary immune deficiencies, only a very few selected examples will be discussed. Combined Deficiencies without Nonimmunologic Abnormalities A great deal of knowledge about the evolution of bone marrow stem cells into functional lymphocytes came from studying children with deficiencies of more than one type of lymphocyte (combined immune deficiencies). The most severe group of immune deficiencies is severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). The most severe form of SCID is reticular dysgenesis (failure of blood cells to develop), in which a common stem cell for all white blood cells is absent; therefore, T cells, B cells, and phagocytic cells never develop (see Fig. 9.10). Most children with reticular dysgenesis die in utero or very soon after birth. Most typically, a defect occurs after stem cells become committed to developing into lymphocytes (lymphoid stem cells); therefore, most individuals with SCID have normal numbers of granulocytes. Most individuals with SCID have few detectable lymphocytes in the circulation and secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes). The thymus is usually underdeveloped because of the absence of T cells. Immunoglobulin levels, especially IgM and IgA, are absent or greatly reduced. At least 20 different forms of SCID have been identified. Depending on the specific genetic mutation, the defect may involve T cells, B cells, and NK cells or may suppress the function of one cell type more severely with relatively minor effects on the others. SCID often results in few or absent T and B lymphocytes in the circulation and secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes). The thymus is usually hypoplastic (underdeveloped) because of the absence of T cells. Immunoglobulin levels, especially of IgM and IgA, are absent or greatly reduced, although IgG levels may be almost normal in the first months of life because of the presence of maternal antibodies. In the most severe defects, death occurs at about 1 year of life. All three cells are adversely affected (T−, B−, NK−) in SCID; it develops from an autosomal recessive enzymatic defect in adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, resulting in the accumulation of toxic purine metabolites to which rapidly dividing cells, such as lymphocytes, are especially sensitive (see Fig. 9.10). ADA deficiency accounts for about 16% of all persons with SCID. The development of T cells, B cells, and NK cells is arrested very early, and very few lymphocytic cells are found in the blood. Mutation of another purine metabolism enzyme, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (purine nucleoside phosphorylase [PNP] deficiency), is less severe than ADA deficiency (see Fig. 9.10). T cells and NK cells appear to be more susceptible to mutations in PNP so that B-cell function can be relatively normal (T−, B+, NK−). X-linked SCID results from a common defect in most of the important cytokine receptors needed for lymphocyte maturation (e.g., IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and others). T cells and NK cells are preferentially affected (T−, B+, NK−), but the defect often results in the production of immature B cells that cannot respond well to antigen because of the lack of Th cells. The most common (44% of those with SCID) is an Xlinked SCID resulting from a defect in the IL-2 receptor gamma (γ)chain (IL-2Rγ). This protein is a component of several receptors for cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. A similar, but autosomal, deficiency occurs with a mutation in JAK3 (JAK3 deficiency), which is an enzyme (a tyrosine kinase) that associates with IL-2Rγ in normal cells and communicates information from the receptor to the nucleus. Thus cells with defects in JAK3 cannot respond to cytokines that bind to these receptors on the cell surface. Another autosomal form of SCID results from mutations in the α chain of the IL-7 receptor (IL-7 receptor deficiency). IL-7 is necessary for the maturation of T cells within the thymus, so that this deficiency has relatively normal levels of B cells and NK cells (T−, B+, NK+). Even if nearly adequate numbers of B and T cells are produced, their cooperation may be defective. The bare lymphocyte syndrome is a group of immune deficiencies characterized by an inability of lymphocytes and macrophages to produce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II molecules. Without MHC molecules, antigen presentation and intercellular cooperation cannot occur effectively (see Fig. 9.10). MHC class I deficiency results from mutations in the genes for the transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP1 or TAP2), which control the transport of antigenic protein fragments across the endoplasmic reticulum and the formation of MHC class I/antigen complexes for transportation to the cell surface (see Fig. 8.15). Because MHC class I molecules preferentially present antigen to CD8+ Tc cells, the resultant deficiency is of CD8+ cytotoxic cells, with normal levels of CD4+ helper cells and normal antibody production. MHC class II deficiency is more severe. A variety of mutations prevent normal production of MHC class II molecules, which present antigen to CD4+ helper cells. Because of defective recruitment of T-helper cells, normal antibody responses are greatly suppressed. Children with this deficiency develop life-threatening infections and usually die before age 5 years. T and B lymphocytes possess receptors for antigen, whereas NK cells do not. Those receptors result from a process of genetic rearrangement of V and J genes to form the variable regions of the L chain (B-cell receptor [BCR]) and the α chain (T-cell receptor [TCR]) and the V, D, and J genes to form the variable regions of the H chain (BCR) and the β chain (TCR). Successful genetic rearrangement is controlled by two recombination activating enzymes (RAG-1 and RAG-2). RAG-1 or RAG-2 deficiencies are autosomal recessive and result in arrested lymphocyte development from blocked recombination of variable regions of B-cell and T-cell receptors (see Fig. 9.10), whereas NK cells are not affected (T−, B−, NK+). Forms of partial SCID, with the defect being primarily of T cells, arise from mutations in several components of the TCR complex (see Fig. 9.10). The TCR is a complex organization of proteins that react with antigen (α and β chains) and then provide an intracellular signal to the nucleus (γ, δ, and ε chains [collectively called CD3] and the associated molecules CD45 and ZAP-70). Examples of these deficiencies include mutations in CD3, CD45, or ZAP-70. The T-cell defect in each can range from mild to severe in nature, with normal B lymphocytes and NK cells (T−, B+, NK+). Although B cells are normal, antibody production may be depressed because of the lack of Th cells. Combined Deficiencies with Nonimmunologic Abnormalities Some combined immune deficiencies are associated with other characteristic defects, some of which appear to be unrelated to the immune system yet may be life threatening by themselves. These associated symptoms can be useful diagnostically and can clarify the pathophysiology of the disease. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS, an X-linked recessive disorder) results from sporadic mutations in the WAS protein (WASP), which is involved in intracellular signaling and regulation of the cell's actin cytoskeleton (see Fig. 9.10). Defects in the cytoskeleton lead to the classic symptoms of thrombocytopenia (with resultant bleeding disorders), scaly eczema, and recurrent infections. IgA and IgG levels are usually normal, but antibody responses against antigens that elicit primarily an IgM response, such as polysaccharides from bacterial capsules (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae [S. pneumoniae], Haemophilus influenzae [H. influenzae]) are deficient. Persons with WAS also have a very high risk of lymphoid malignancies (leukemias and lymphomas). Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a large variety of sporadic mutations in the ATM gene, which encodes a protein involved in repair of double-stranded breaks in DNA. Affected infants often develop ataxia (unsteady gait), which usually becomes apparent when the child is learning to walk. The neurologic defect may eventually lead to confinement in a wheelchair. Telangiectasia (dilation of capillaries) can occur in the eyes and skin, especially on the ears, neck, and extremities. Both B cells and T cells are variably affected and unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks are commonly observed in the regions encoding the T-cell and B-cell receptors. About 70% of those with AT are IgA deficient, occasionally accompanied by deficiencies in IgG (see Fig. 9.10). Individuals with AT are at high risk for developing leukemias and lymphomas. DiGeorge syndrome (congenital thymic aplasia or hypoplasia and diminished parathyroid gland development) is caused by the lack or partial lack of the thymus, resulting in greatly decreased T-cell numbers and function and life-threatening viral, fungal, and intracellular bacterial infections.35 The defect is usually attributed to deletions on chromosome 22 (some deletions also have been identified on chromosome 10),36 about 25% of which are inherited. The deleted region encodes information for formation of organs that originate from the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches during the twelfth week of gestation. Defective development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches during embryogenesis results in the thymic defects, lack of the parathyroid gland (causing an inability to regulate calcium concentration), major structural defects in the heart and the aorta (resulting in inadequate blood flow and inadequate oxygenation of the tissues), and abnormal facial characteristics (e.g., underdeveloped chin, low-set ears, shortened structure of the upper lip) (see Fig. E 9.2 on Evolve). Low blood calcium levels cause the development of tetany or involuntary rigid muscular contraction. Predominantly Antibody Deficiencies Predominantly antibody deficiencies result from defects in B-cell maturation or function and are the most common immune deficiencies. T-cell immune responses are not affected in pure Blymphocyte deficiencies. These deficiencies are widely characterized by lower levels of circulating immunoglobulins (hypogammaglobulinemia) or occasionally totally or nearly absent immunoglobulins (agammaglobulinemia). Recurrent infections range from life threatening to mild, depending on the severity of the deficiency. Characteristic infections include encapsulated bacteria (e.g., S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae) that may cause pneumonia or sepsis and other microorganisms that cause infections of the sinuses, ears, and gastrointestinal tract. One of the most severe B-lymphocyte deficiencies is Bruton agammaglobulinemia. This condition results from mutations in the gene for Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk)—an enzyme involved in intracellular signaling from several B-cell receptors, including the IgM B-cell antigen receptor, the IL-5 receptor, and the IL-6 receptor. Ineffective signaling results in the arrest of the development in the bone marrow of early cells in the B-cell lineage into mature B cells37 (see Fig. 9.10). Somewhat less than a third of the mutations are sporadic. Few or no circulating mature B cells are present, although Tcell number and function are normal. At 6 months of life, the approximate normal serum concentrations of immunoglobulins are the following: IgG, 400 mg/dL; IgM, 40 mg/dL; and IgA, 30 mg/dL. In 6-month-old children with Bruton agammaglobulinemia, serum IgG levels are much less than 100 mg/dL, and IgM and IgA are almost absent. An autosomal recessive form of agammaglobulinemia (autosomal agammaglobulinemia) results from other mutations in the B-cell receptor. The most common is a mutation of the mu (µ) chain of the IgM portion of the receptor. This mutation prevents intracellular signaling after antigen binds to the receptor, leading to blocked maturation, the absence of antibody production, and very severe infections. Common variable immune deficiency is the most commonly diagnosed immune deficiency. As the name implies, the presentation is very heterogeneous. It is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, but the particular class of antibody that is decreased varies. Most individuals have low amounts of IgG, which may or may not be accompanied by decreased levels of IgA or IgM, or both, with normal numbers of B cells. Some may have accompanying T-cell defects. Multiple genetic defects in terminal differentiation account for this condition, although the specific defects have not been identified in most people. The age of onset of symptoms, such as recurrent bacterial respiratory tract infections, is generally later than most primary immune deficiencies (late 20s). Secondary complications include arthritis (infectious and noninfectious), gastrointestinal symptoms (malabsorption, chronic diarrhea), autoimmune disease (anemia, thrombocytopenia, endocrine diseases), and cancer (of the lymphoid system, skin, and gastrointestinal tract). Some defects may involve a particular class of antibody, such as selective IgA deficiency, in which only IgA is suppressed. Because many affected individuals are asymptomatic, the true incidence is uncertain, although clinically relevant symptoms may occur in 1 in 700 to 1 in 400 individuals. Individuals with selective IgA deficiency are able to produce other classes of immunoglobulins but fail to produce IgA (see Fig. 9.10). Many will have B cells that have undergone class-switch to IgA but, for unknown reasons, cannot undergo the terminal steps of differentiation to IgA-secreting plasma cells. Affected individuals may have a history of recurring sinus, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal infections, particularly chronic intestinal candidiasis (infection with C. albicans). Complications of IgA deficiency include severe allergic disease and autoimmune diseases. Selective IgA deficiency is two or three times more common in atopic individuals than in others. Secretory IgA normally may prevent the uptake of allergens from the environment, so that IgA deficiency may lead to a more intense challenge to the immune system by prolonged exposure to environmental antigens. One of the most severe complications of IgA deficiency is an anaphylactic reaction that can follow administration of blood products that contain IgA. Serious anaphylactic reactions can occur in individuals totally lacking IgA because the immune system recognizes donor IgA as a foreign antigen. Initial sensitization can occur in fetal life through exposure to maternal IgA that leaks across the placenta or later through the ingestion of maternal IgA in breast milk or bovine IgA in cow's milk. Sensitization also can occur with initial administration of blood products containing IgA. The individual's primed immune system then acts against donor IgA on subsequent exposure. Several defects in antibody class-switch have been identified (see Fig. 9.10). A defect in a DNA editing enzyme (activation-induced cytidine deaminase deficiency; AICD deficiency) also inhibits classswitch. During class-switch and movement of the H chain genetic information for the variable region to a different constant region gene, the double-stranded DNA must be cut and mended. This enzyme is responsible for cutting and mending the DNA; thus IgM may be overproduced and levels of IgG and IgA diminished. Deficiencies in certain subclasses of antibody (IgG subclass deficiency), particularly IgG2, may result from a defect in switch to a particular subclass constant region (see Fig. 9.10). The level of IgG2 subclass is often increased in response to polysaccharide antigens such as those on the surface of encapsulated bacteria. Low levels of IgG2 may be responsible for recurrent risk for pneumonias caused by these bacteria. Whether IgG subclass deficiencies are unique immune deficiency conditions is unclear because many are apparently early indications of the development of common variable immune deficiency or are secondary to selective IgA deficiency. X-linked or autosomal recessive hyper-IgM syndrome results from a mutation in the CD40 ligand (CD40L deficiency) or, less commonly, the CD40 receptor (CD40 deficiency), respectively.38 The CD40/CD40L interaction provides an important signal between Thelper (Th) cells and B cells during the initiation of class-switch (see Fig. 8.18). A critical ligand-receptor interaction occurs between the receptor CD40 on the B cell and its ligand (CD154 or CD40L) on the Th cell. A mutation in CD40L or CD40 results in defective classswitch, decreased or absent production of IgG and IgA, poor development of memory B cells, and overproduction of IgM, resulting in increased infections with opportunistic bacteria. T-cell immunity is not affected. This particular immune deficiency is co-listed as a combined immune deficiency because of the potential of mutations that affect either the Th cell or the B cell. Immune Dysregulation The classification of immune dysregulation presents causes of immune deficiencies and includes conditions in which the regulation of components of the immune system is predominant. Perforin deficiency results from a mutation in perforin, which is an important component of cellular killing by cytotoxic T cells and NK cells (see Fig. 8.26), resulting in decreased or absent Tc and NK cells. Several other deficiencies result from mutations in secretory vesicle function, including fusion with the cell membrane and other aspects of the process. Mutations in interleukin IL-10 or its receptor IL-10R suppress the production or response to IL-10 (an immunosuppressive cytokine), resulting in excessive inflammation and an increased risk for early-onset inflammatory bowel disease, or recurrent respiratory disease.39 Chédiak-Higashi syndrome results from a defect in the movement of cytoplasmic granules and is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene (CHS1). The CHS1 protein helps control movement of granules to cellular membranes in preparation for degranulation. As a result of these mutations, the granules remain in the cytoplasm and form large aggregates that are readily apparent microscopically. Leukocytes from individuals with Chédiak-Higashi syndrome have decreased chemotaxis, granular fusion, and bacterial killing. Platelet granules also may be affected, resulting in prolonged bleeding, and partial albinism can occur because of defects in melanocyte granules. Affected children develop recurrent infections of the skin, respiratory tract, and mucous membranes, especially with gram-positive bacteria. Phagocyte Defects: Numbers, Function, or Both Phagocyte defects range from inadequate numbers of phagocytes (e.g., severe congenital neutropenia) to defects in phagocyte function that can result in recurrent infections (Fig. 9.11). Because phagocytosis is generally aided by bacterial opsonization with IgG or C3b, infection occurs with the same group of microorganisms (encapsulated bacteria) that are associated with antibody and complement deficiencies. FIGURE 9.11 Phagocytic Defects. Several genetic defects in the process leading up to and including phagocytosis result in increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. See the text and refer to Fig. 7.15 for more detailed information. The phagocyte leaves the bloodstream and enters the tissue through interactions between leukocyte and endothelial adhesion molecules and the process of diapedesis. The cell is attracted to the inflammatory site by chemotaxis, where it encounters opsonized bacteria, and attaches to and engulfs the microorganism. Inside the phagocyte the bacteria are killed and broken down by the combination of lysosomal granule constituents and reactive oxygen products of the hexosemonophosphate shunt and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. C3R, C3 receptor, which includes the C3b receptor (C3bR); FcγR, receptor for the Fc portion of IgG; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; , reactive oxygen. Inadequate numbers of phagocytes, particularly neutrophils (severe congenital neutropenias), result in a variety of recurrent and severe bacterial infections beginning early in life. Approximately 50% of these individuals have mutations in the gene for elastase, neutrophilexpressed (ELANE). Other mutations have been identified (e.g., WAS gene) in the other 50%. A milder form, cyclic neutropenia, is autosomal dominant with almost 100% of affected individuals having a mutation in the ELA2 gene. Changes in neutrophil levels are cyclic and may remain at or near normal for 2 to 3 weeks, followed by periods of neutropenia lasting a few days to weeks. During the neutropenia, the individual has increased susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is group of disorders resulting from severe X-linked (about 70% of the individuals) or autosomal defects in the respiratory burst necessary for the myeloperoxidase–hydrogen peroxide system, a major means of bacterial destruction using the enzyme myeloperoxidase, halides (e.g., chloride ion), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).40 Neutrophils and other phagocytes switch much of their glucose metabolism to the hexosemonophosphate shunt during phagocytosis A byproduct of this pathway is the conversion of molecular oxygen by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase into highly reactive oxygen derivatives, including hydrogen peroxide. Mutations in NADPH oxidase or other components of the NADPH oxidase complex result in deficient production of hydrogen peroxide and other oxygen products. Thus affected individuals have adequate myeloperoxidase in the primary granules and halide but lack the necessary hydrogen peroxide, resulting in recurrent severe pneumonias; tumor-like granulomata in lungs, skin, and bones; and other infections with some opportunistic microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Aspergillus spp. The symptoms usually appear in the first 2 years of life. Recurrent infections occur with rather innocuous catalase-positive microorganisms, whereas infections with more virulent catalasenegative microorganisms (e.g., S. pneumoniae) are rare. Most microorganisms produce their own hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct, which accumulates in the phagocytic vacuole and can be used by the phagocyte's myeloperoxidase to kill the microorganism. Some microorganisms also produce the enzyme catalase, which breaks down hydrogen peroxide. Thus catalase-negative microorganisms donate hydrogen peroxide to the phagocyte's myeloperoxidase, leading to their own death. Catalase-positive microorganisms, however, destroy the bacterial hydrogen peroxide and survive to cause infection. A deficiency in another component of the myeloperoxidase– hydrogen peroxide system, myeloperoxidase deficiency, is a relatively mild disorder characterized by a complete or partial deficiency in myeloperoxidase. Individuals do not have severe recurrent infections because most infectious bacteria are sensitive to direct killing by many of the toxic oxygen molecules produced by NADPH oxidase. The exception is the person with concurrent diabetes, who may have recurrent disseminated candidiasis. Other phagocytic deficiencies include defects in various leukocyte adhesion molecules (leukocyte adhesion deficiency) that prevent adherence to the vascular endothelium and diapedesis. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency, type 1 (LAD-1) results from an autosomal recessive mutation in CD18, which is a β2-integrin chain that is shared by several different receptors. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency, type 2 (LAD-2) results from a defect in adding the monosaccharide fucose to carbohydrates on the phagocyte surface. Surface carbohydrates with fucose are ligands for selectins on the endothelium and leukocytes. These and other defects in leukocyte adhesion molecules usually result in increased levels of neutrophils in the blood (leukocytosis, because they cannot leave the circulation) and in increased recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. Additional deficiencies diminish the leukocyte's capacity to respond to cytokines. Defects in the interferon-γ receptor result in increased susceptibility to infection with pathogenic intracellular bacteria, such as Mycobacteria and Salmonella. Defects in Innate Immunity Some immune deficiencies are characterized by a defect in the capacity to produce a protective innate response against microorganisms. The inherited form of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis presents with mild to extremely severe recurrent infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes with Candida albicans. In this condition, the response of macrophages to Th17 lymphocytes is defective because of mutations in IL-17 produced by Th17 lymphocytes or the IL-17 receptor on macrophages.41 Thus the macrophage cannot be adequately activated to defend against Candida albicans. Autoinflammatory Disorders Autoinflammatory disorders are characterized by abnormally high levels of inflammation secondary to mutations in control of inflammasome activation or in defects in cellular receptors of cytokines designed to decrease inflammation. These disorders are frequently related to diminished control of infections of epithelial surfaces. Familial Mediterranean fever is an autosomal recessive disorder in eastern Mediterranean populations that results in uncontrolled release of IL-1β by inflammasomes in granulocytes and monocyes.42 Affected individuals present with skin rashes, usually of the lower extremities, and fever. Complement Deficiencies Complement activation is a necessary component of protection against many infectious agents, particularly bacteria. IgG and complement components, such as C3b, are opsonins and facilitate phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. Thus complement deficiencies often resemble antibody deficiencies. Recurrent lifethreatening infections at an early age with encapsulated bacteria (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae) that are very sensitive to opsonin-assisted phagocytosis may occur. Activation of C3 is central to the complement cascade. All three pathways of complement activation (i.e., classical, alternative, and lectin pathways) result in activation of C3 into C3b and C3a; C3b is a major opsonin and also is the activator of the terminal components of the cascade (C6 through C9). C3 deficiency is the most severe complement deficiency (Fig. 9.12). Factor I and factor H are major regulators of the complement cascade and control the level of spontaneous activation of C3. Factor I deficiency and factor H deficiency can be severe because they lead to increased spontaneous destruction of C3 and a secondary C3 deficiency. FIGURE 9.12 Complement Defects. The complement cascade is initiated through three pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. Each of the three pathways produces a C3 convertase, which activates C3 leading to the formation of a C5 convertase. The activation of C5 initiates formation of the membrane attack complex. For more details, see the text and Fig. 7.6. The most severe defect is a C3 deficiency because it blocks all three pathways. MASP, MBL-associated serine protease; MBL, mannose-binding lectin. Deficiencies of lesser severity have been described in each of the pathways of complement activation. Defects in the classical pathway (i.e., C1, C2, C4) result in increased risk for recurrent infections, sometimes severe, with encapsulated bacteria at an early age.43 Defects in the early components of the classical pathway also result in a SLElike syndrome that may be complicated by kidney disease (glomerulonephritis), suggesting a role of these components in removal of naturally occurring immune complexes from the circulation.44 C2 deficiency, more so than C1 or C4 deficiencies, also has an increased risk for recurrent respiratory tract infections with encapsulated bacteria. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency is the primary defect of the lectin pathway of complement activation.45 The defect results in increased risk of infection with microorganisms that have polysaccharide capsules rich in mannose, particularly the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitides and S. pneumonia. Properdin deficiency is the most common defect in the alternative pathway, is associated with recurrent infections with Neisseria meningitides, and is X-linked, whereas all other complement deficiencies are autosomal recessive. Symptoms generally appear in the second decade of life. Deficiencies of any of the terminal components of the complement cascade (C5, C6, C7, or C8 deficiencies) are associated with increased infections with only one group of bacteria—those of the genus Neisseria, particularly Neisseria meningitides. Neisseria usually causes localized infections (meningitis or gonorrhea), but terminal pathway defects result in an 8000-fold increased risk for systemic infections with atypical strains of these microorganisms. C9 deficiency is the most common terminal pathway defect, appears primarily in Japanese populations, and is generally asymptomatic. The other deficiencies of the terminal pathway are extremely rare, but are characterized by more aggressive infections. The risk for systemic infections with Neisseria is also increased in those with deficiencies of C2, factor D, factor B, and properdin. Secondary Immune Deficiencies Secondary, or acquired, immune and inflammatory deficiencies are far more common than primary deficiencies. These deficiencies are complications of other physiologic or pathophysiologic conditions (Table 9.7). Although secondary deficiencies are common, many are not clinically relevant. In many cases, the degree of the immune deficiency is relatively minor and without any apparent increased susceptibility to infection. Alternatively, the immune system may be substantially suppressed, but only for a short duration, thus minimizing the incidence of clinically relevant infections. Some secondary immune deficiencies (e.g., AIDS or immunosuppression by cancer), however, are extremely severe and may result in recurrent life-threatening infections. TABLE 9.7 EXAMPLES OF SECONDARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCIES CAUSE OF DEFICIENCY EXAMPLES Normal physiologic conditions Pregnancy Premature infants Infancy Aging Psychologic stresses Emotional trauma Eating disorders Dietary insufficiencies Protein-calorie malnutrition Protein loss syndromes (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy) Vitamin deficiencies Malignancies Hematologic malignancies (e.g., Hodgkin disease, acute or chronic leukemia, myeloma) Solid tumors (e.g., sarcomas, carcinomas) Chronic diseases Diabetes Cystic fibrosis Alcoholic cirrhosis Sickle cell disease Aplastic anemia Autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) Chromosome abnormalities Environmental agents Physical trauma Medical treatments Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) Ultraviolet light Ionizing radiation Chronic hypoxia Burns Stress from surgery Anesthesia Immunosuppressive treatments (e.g., corticosteroids, antilymphocyte antibodies) Splenectomy Anticonvulsive medications Cancer treatment (e.g., cytotoxic drugs, ionizing radiation) Hematopoietic stem cell transplants Infections Lifestyle Congenital inflections (e.g., rubella, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B) Acquired infections (e.g., AIDS) Alcohol abuse Normal Physiologic Conditions The competence of an individual's immune system varies throughout life. Pregnancy itself is considered by many to be an immunocompromised condition. Pregnant women may have decreased reactivity or altered results in several tests of the immune system, including skin tests against various antigens, circulating numbers of T lymphocytes, and other very general tests. Pregnancy itself, however, is not associated with a marked change in infections, suggesting that the mother's immune system is not severely altered. The newborn child is immunologically immature. Although T-cell immune responses may be normal or near normal, other components of the immune system (especially antibody production) are just beginning to mature. Beginning at about 32 weeks of pregnancy, the placenta transports maternal antibodies into the fetal blood to protect the child during the first months of life (see Fig. 8.29). After the delivery, the level of the mother's antibodies slowly decreases in the newborn so that maternal antibodies no longer protect the child by about 6 months of life. By 6 to 8 months, the newborn should be efficiently protected by antibodies produced by its own B cells. In some infants, the development of antibody production is delayed, and a transient low level of antibody may persist for several months (transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy), during which the child has increased susceptibility to infections. Premature infants are particularly immunologically immature and are at increased risk for neonatal infections. The blood of infants born before 32 weeks' gestation is generally devoid of maternal antibody. However, if the infant is born prematurely, the degree of immunologic immaturity is greater and places the child at a significant risk of developing infections. Aging is also associated with a progressive depression in immune responses. Older adults generally have more severe bacterial and fungal infections, greater difficulty resolving those infections, and lower responses to vaccination. Several meaningful changes occur during aging, although variations in the degree of change and a corresponding increased susceptibility to infection can be considerable among individuals. The thymus involutes over time, resulting in decreased production of fresh T cells. A concurrent depletion of Tmemory cells results in depressed responses to both new and “recall” antigens. A shift toward Th2 cells also may occur with a resultant decrease in Th1 cytokines. Total numbers of B cells may decrease. Numbers of NK cells may remain normal, although their activity is decreased. Similarly, neutrophil numbers may remain normal, with decreased phagocytosis and killing. Psychologic Stress The relationship between emotional stress and depressed immune function has become an area of intense clinical and research interest. For many decades anecdotal reports have suggested that increased incidences of infection and malignancy are associated with periods of both intense stress (e.g., the loss of a loved one, divorce) and relatively minor stress (e.g., final examination periods at colleges and universities). In addition, early studies showed that immune function, as demonstrated by delayed hypersensitivity skin test results, could be depressed through posthypnotic suggestion. The mechanisms of the relationship between emotional stress and the immune system are now beginning to be understood. Many lymphoid organs are innervated and can be affected by nerve stimulation. In addition, lymphocytes have receptors for many hormones (e.g., sex hormones, neurotransmitters, and neuropeptides) and can respond to changing levels of these chemicals with increased or decreased function. For instance, stress-induced catecholamines affect the expression of adhesion molecules and the movement of lymphocytes among lymphoid organs. (Further discussion of the effects of stress on susceptibility to disease is the subject of Chapter 11.) Physical Trauma Trauma that compromises the epithelial barrier also predisposes an individual to infection. Burn victims are susceptible to severe bacterial infections. Thermal burns appear to be associated with suppressed neutrophil function (especially chemotaxis), complement levels, cellmediated immunity, and primary humoral responses, although secondary humoral responses are normal. The mechanism of this immunosuppression may be twofold. Blood from burned individuals contains nonspecific immunosuppressive factors (all immune responses are suppressed, regardless of the antigen involved). In addition, burn victims also have increased regulatory T-cell function, which may increase antigen-specific suppression. Environmental Agents Individuals are constantly exposed to environmental agents that affect the immune system. UV light from sun exposure or tanning salons induces apoptosis of lymphoid stem cells, increases production of Treg cells that suppress defenses against cancer, and increases production of antiinflammatory cytokines. Dietary Insufficiencies Nutritional status can have a profound effect on immune function, and malnutrition is the predominant cause of secondary immune deficiencies worldwide. Severe deficits in protein or calorie (proteincalorie malnutrition) intake lead to immune deficiencies. Marasmus (deficiency in calories) and kwashiorkor (deficiency in protein, but adequate calories) have similar outcomes. T-cell–rich areas of primary (thymus) and secondary lymphoid tissue are greatly affected, resulting in impaired T-cell function. Antibody levels are normal but neutrophil function (chemotaxis, phagocytosis, bacterial killing), complement levels, and NK activity are impaired, resulting in infections with microorganisms that are normally destroyed by opsonization and phagocytosis. Deficient zinc intake can profoundly depress both T- and B-cell function. Zinc is required as a cofactor for at least 70 different enzymes, some of which are found in lymphocytes and are necessary for their function. Secondary zinc deficiencies may be associated with malabsorption syndrome (failure to absorb zinc), chronic renal disease (loss of zinc in the urine), chronic diarrhea (loss of zinc through the gut), or burns or severe psoriasis (loss of zinc through the skin). Deficiencies of other enzyme cofactors, such as vitamins (e.g., pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, E, and B12), also may result in severe depressions of B- and T-cell function, phagocytosis, and complement activity. Chronic Diseases Chronic diseases of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and renal systems are commonly complicated by a secondary immune suppression. Nephrotic syndrome from inflammation of the kidneys results in loss of protein through the kidneys, proteinuria (increased protein in the urine), and resultant hypoproteinemia (diminished protein in the blood). The loss of IgG may increase susceptibility of infection. Protein-losing enteropathy results from conditions that damage the surface of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, gastrointestinal [GI] infections, cancer of the GI tract). Although circulating levels of immunoglobulin are diminished because of loss through the GI tract and catabolism, increased susceptibility to infections is rare. Metabolic Diseases or Genetic Syndromes Diabetes results in altered glucose metabolism and suppresses many aspects of the immune and inflammatory responses, including phagocytosis and chemotaxis, and lymphocyte proliferation. The effects of trisomy 21 are less severe, but primarily include diminished neutrophil function. People with cystic fibrosis have decreased airway clearance of bacteria, thus increasing the probability of major respiratory tract infections. Malignancies Many malignancies are complicated by a wasting syndrome (cachexia) in the later stages, which can suppress the immune system secondary to the resultant malnutrition. The effect is commonly nonspecific, resulting in a generalized deficiency of the immune response and a greatly increased susceptibility to developing lifethreatening infections. In fact, many people with malignancies die from infection rather than from direct effects of the tumor. Other malignancies (e.g., lymphomas, leukemias, plasmacytomas) present with an early and more specific immune depression. NonHodgkin lymphoma may result in an antibody deficiency in the most advanced stages of the disease. Hodgkin lymphoma, however, may suppress the immune system even before the onset of symptoms, with worsening of the suppression as the disease progresses. Individuals usually present with depletion of T cells with normal production of Tcell–independent antibodies. In general, leukemia is characterized by normal T- and B-cell responses until progression to terminal stages. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia commonly suppresses B-cell differentiation but does not affect T-cell function. Depressed production of antibodies results in increased susceptibility to fatal infection. Plasmacytomas (malignancies of plasma cells) result in greatly diminished antibodies because the malignant cells are displacing normal plasma cells and increased catabolism of immunoglobulins results in increased susceptibility to infections against which antibody is protective. T-cell immunity remains intact. Medical Treatments Medical treatments themselves may produce suppression of immune responses. Surgery and administration of anesthesia can suppress Tand B-cell function. Transient, severe lymphopenia (loss of circulating lymphocytes) is a common postoperative condition that can last as long as a month. Surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy) can result in a depressed IgM response against encapsulated bacteria (especially S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A streptococci, and Neisseria meningitidis) and decreased levels of opsonins. Corticosteroids are intentionally used to suppress the immune system and control hypersensitivity diseases (especially autoimmune disease) or prevent rejection of transplants. They predominantly inhibit T-cell function, prevent lymphocyte proliferation, inhibit production of critical cytokines, and suppress monocyte/macrophage functions; but they do not affect neutrophils. Because of their nonspecific activity, however, immune responses against infectious agents also can be suppressed, increasing an individual's susceptibility to infection. Many drugs and other treatments that are used to fight cancer (e.g., cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic agents, irradiation) are not specific for cancer cells, but are designed to attack cells in susceptible stages in their cell cycles or rapidly proliferating cells, which includes cells of the immune system as well as malignant cells. Cytotoxic agents may affect all lymphocyte subsets or may only affect a specific stage of the immune response. For instance, azathioprine and methotrexate affect response after antigenic challenge, whereas cyclophosphamide affects response before and after exposure to antigen. Cyclosporine A preferably affects CD4+ cells. The immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapeutic drugs are exacerbated by concurrent treatment with ionizing radiation (x-rays), which also affects rapidly dividing cells. T cells, particularly CD4+ cells, are most sensitive. Phagocytes, which have a much slower proliferation rate, are relatively resistant to the effects of irradiation. Depending on the dose of irradiation administered, the entire immune system may be depleted. The list of medications that affect the immune response is ever increasing and includes analgesics, antithyroid medications, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antimicrobial agents, antilymphocyte antibodies, and tranquilizers. Infections Many infectious microorganisms successfully invade the human body using mechanisms for fighting off specific immune/inflammatory responses against themselves (discussed in Chapter 10). However, some infectious agents more broadly suppress the immune response. HIV is one of the few microorganisms that directly attacks the central processes involved in the development of an immune response (discussed in detail in Chapter 10). It infects and destroys the T-helper cell, which is necessary to provide help for the maturation of both plasma cells and T-cytotoxic cells. Therefore, HIV suppresses the immune response against itself and secondarily creates a generalized immune deficiency by suppressing the development of immune responses against other pathogens and opportunistic microorganisms. Several other viruses (e.g., measles; hepatitis B; and herpes viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus [CMV], and herpes simplex viruses) may suppress various components of the immune response. CMV, herpes virus, and hepatitis B virus in particular can establish congenital infections through transmission from an infected mother to the child in utero or at birth when the child's immune system is immature. These children may have suppressed immune responses, although the degree of the deficiency is not usually severe. However, as the child's immune system develops, the viral antigens may be partially seen as “self” so that a chronic infection is established. Measles virus can infect both B and T cells and macrophages. Infection may result in lymphopenia and a suppressed T-cell response that are generally transient. Acute infections with herpes viruses may transiently suppress the immune system. EBV infects B cells and may cause infectious mononucleosis, although most EBV infections are asymptomatic. The virus enters a stage of latency in memory B cells. In some cases, EBV may suppress both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Immunosuppression is generally transient and not severe. CMV infects mucosal epithelium and can infect macrophages where antigen processing and presentation may be impaired. Other infections may lead to a relatively broad suppression of immune responses. Mycobacterium leprae causes two forms of leprosy: tuberculoid leprosy, in which an active T-cell immunity contains and kills the infecting bacteria; and lepromatous leprosy, in which the infected individual's T-cell immunity is severely depressed but high levels of antibody are produced. The T-cell deficit is characterized by suppressed T-cell IL-2 production and antigen-specific T-cell responses. Some fungal infections may suppress the immune response. In disseminated Candida albicans infections, T-cell responses and neutrophil chemotaxis are suppressed to various degrees. Similar immunosuppression may be observed in individuals with disseminated histoplasmosis (infections with Histoplasma capsulatum). The most severe form of acute malaria (caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum) suppresses specific antibody responses against protein and polysaccharide antigens by dysregulation of CD4+ T-cell function and decreased IL-2 production. Evaluation and Care of Those with Immune Deficiency Routine care of individuals with immune deficiencies must be tempered with the knowledge that the immune system may be totally ineffective. Administration of conventional immunizing agents or blood products to these individuals may be unsafe because of the risk that the immunizing agent will cause an uncontrolled infection. Attenuated vaccines contain live but weakened microorganisms (e.g., live polio vaccine; vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella) that can cause disseminated infection. Although the vaccine virus is attenuated enough to be destroyed by a normal immune system, it can survive, multiply, and cause severe disease in an immune-deficient recipient. Additionally, even healthy recipients of vaccines containing live microorganisms can shed those microorganisms for a short time, increasing the risk of infection to family members or other close associates who are immune deficient. Even simple procedures, such as penetrating the skin for routine blood tests, may lead to fatal septicemia (bacterial infection of the blood) in the immune-deficient person. Individuals with immune deficiencies are also at risk for graftversus-host disease (GVHD). Mature T cells in a transplanted graft (e.g., transfused blood) are capable of a destructive cell-mediated reaction against unmatched histocompatibility antigens on the tissues in the graft recipient. Symptoms of an acute graft-versus-host reaction usually appear within 10 to 30 days after the transplant. The primary targets for GVHD are the skin (e.g., rash, loss or increase of pigment, thickening of skin), liver (e.g., damage to bile duct, hepatomegaly), mouth (e.g., dry mouth, ulcers, infections), eyes (e.g., burning, irritation, dryness), and gastrointestinal tract (e.g., severe diarrhea) and may lead to death from infections. GVHD is not a problem when the recipient is immunocompetent, that is, has an immune system that can control the donor's lymphocytes. If, however, the recipient's immune system is deficient, the grafted T cells remain unchecked and attack the recipient's tissues. Most GVHD is prevented by treating whole blood with irradiation to kill white blood cells before transfusion. The most common presenting symptom of immune deficiencies is recurrent severe infections. Significant information concerning the nature of the specific immune deficiency can be obtained by noting the types of infection, as well as certain characteristics of the affected individual, including gender, age of disease onset, the presence of any associated anomalies, family history, and risk factors associated with secondary immune deficiencies.46 Humoral deficiencies are generally characterized by recurrent sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated bacteria, gastrointestinal malabsorption, and poor growth. T-cell defects generally present with failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, persistent thrush, and opportunistic infections (e.g., Mycobacterium, Pneumocystis, Candida, and certain viruses). Phagocytic defects are usually associated with recurrent abscesses, oral ulcers, and infections with specific bacteria (e.g., catalase-positive bacteria). Complement defects may be linked to SLE-like disease and recurrent and disseminated infections with Neisseria spp. A variety of laboratory tests are available to evaluate specific immune deficiencies (Table 9.8). The choice of which particular tests to perform is determined on the characteristics described previously. A basic screening test is a complete blood count (CBC) with a differential. The CBC provides information on the numbers of red cells, white cells, and platelets, and the differential indicates the quantities of lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes in the blood. Quantitative determination of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) is a screening test for antibody production, and an assay for total complement (total hemolytic complement, CH50) is useful if a complement defect is suspected. TABLE 9.8 LABORATORY EVALUATION OF IMMUNODEFICIENCIES FUNCTION TESTED LABORATORY TEST INTERPRETATION OF TEST Tests of Humoral Immune Function Antibody production B-cell numbers Total immunoglobulin levels Presence of antibody-producing B cells Levels of isohemagglutinins Capacity to produce specific IgM antibodies Levels of antibodies against vaccines —especially diphtheria and tetanus toxoids Capacity to produce specific IgG antibodies Numbers of lymphocytes with surface Presence of circulating B cells immunoglobulin Tests of Cellular Immune Function Delayed Skin test reaction against previously hypersensitivity encountered antigens—especially Candida albicans or tetanus toxoid Presence of antigen-responsive T cells and skin test cellular interactions (e.g., lymphokine activity and macrophage function) T-cell numbers Numbers of T cells forming rosettes with sheep erythrocytes or expressing membrane CD3 or CD11 antigen Presence of circulating T cells T-cell proliferation in vitro Proliferative response to nonspecific mitogens (e.g., phytohemagglutinin) Capacity of all T cells to divide in response to nonspecific stimulation (mitogens) Proliferative response to antigens (e.g., tetanus toxoid) Capacity of antigen-reactive T cells to respond to antigen Many PIDs result from single gene mutations.41 Diagnosis can frequently be confirmed by appropriate genetic analysis. If the nature of the immune deficiency remains uncertain after the screening tests, additional relatively common tests can be performed. For instance, subpopulations of lymphocytes (T or B) can be quantified using characteristic surface markers, such as surface immunoglobulin for B cells and CD3 for T cells. T-cell populations can be further subdivided using additional surface markers, such as CD4 (T-helper cells) or CD8 (T-cytotoxic cells). For antibodies, routine assays are available to quantify subclasses of IgG, such as IgG2. An additional level of testing would include determination of immune responses against specific antigens. Determination of isohemagglutinins is informative about antigen-specific IgM production. Antibody responses to vaccines (e.g., tetanus, pertussis, measles, diphtheria, hepatitis B) are usually indicative of IgG responses. T-cell immunity against specific antigens can be measured by skin tests against antigens to which the individual had been exposed: “recall antigens.” These include antigens from vaccines (e.g., mumps, tetanus) or from microorganisms with which the person had a previous active infection (e.g., Candida). An adequate T-cell immunity results in a positive delayed hypersensitivity skin test reaction. If the tests do not identify the immune deficiency, more esoteric tests are offered by reference laboratories or research laboratories. These include quantification of individual complement components, in vitro proliferation (mitogenic response) of T or B cells to antigens or nonspecific mitogens, and a variety of tests of phagocyte function (e.g., nitroblue tetrazolium test [NBT] for hexose-monophosphate shunt activity, specific tests for phagocytosis, chemotaxis, or bacterial killing). Replacement Therapies for Immune Deficiencies Diagnosis of primary immune deficiencies (PIDs) and administration of appropriate therapy remain a problem. Most individuals with such deficiencies are initially seen by primary care physicians, particularly family practice physicians or pediatricians. Most primary immune deficiencies are rare, affecting about 1 in 1200 individuals in the United States. The most common primary immune deficiency disease is common variable immune deficiency (about 1 in 2400 individuals). The variable presentations of this disorder lead to difficult diagnosis. The average time span from onset of the immune deficiency to diagnosis has been estimated to be longer than 12 years. The most common PIDs handled by primary care physicians are selective IgA deficiency and chronic granulomatous disease.47 Gamma-Globulin Therapy Many immune deficiencies can be successfully treated by replacing the missing component of the immune system. Individuals with B-cell deficiencies that cause hypogammaglobulinemia or agammaglobulinemia are usually treated by administration of immune gamma-globulin by intramuscular or intravenous (IVIg) routes. Administration by subcutaneous injection has been recently approved and is replacing intramuscular injections. Ig contains antibody-rich fractions prepared from plasma pooled from large numbers of donors. Administration of gamma-globulin replaces the individual's antibodies temporarily; these antibodies have a half-life of 3 to 4 weeks. Thus individuals must be treated repeatedly to maintain a protective level of antibodies in the blood. Gamma-globulin therapy has become routine for common variable immune deficiency, hyperIgM syndromes, SCID, and X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton). The schedule and dosage of gamma-globulin vary among individuals and are primarily determined by body weight, the degree of gammaglobulinemia, and the incidence of infections in the individual. Commercial gamma-globulin preparations usually contain small amounts of IgM and IgA. Individuals with selective IgA deficiency occasionally develop allergic reactions to IgA in gammaglobulin preparations. Individuals who need larger amounts of IgM or IgA can be given fresh frozen plasma in monthly IV infusions. Complications associated with plasma therapy include the potential transmission of blood-borne viruses for which no assay is yet available. The plasma is irradiated to destroy immunocompetent T cells to avoid GVHD in individuals with accompanying T-cell deficiencies. Administration of fresh frozen plasma is successful in individuals with WAS (IgM deficient), AT (IgA deficient), or complement component deficiencies. Transplantation and Transfusion Several primary immune deficiencies originate from defects in lymphoid stem cells that interfere with their development in the primary lymphoid organs. Some of these (e.g., SCID, WAS, leukocyte adhesion defect) have benefited from replacement of stem cells through transplantation of bone marrow, umbilical cord cells, or other cell populations that are rich in stem cells. The source of donor cells, particularly bone marrow, may contain a mixed population of stem cells and more mature T lymphocytes. In order to avoid GVHD, the preferred donor would be matched with the recipient for HLA antigens. Several other diseases involving depletion of the bone marrow (i.e., aplastic anemia, leukemia requiring eradication of tumor cells in the marrow) also are treated by bone marrow transplantation. At least 75% of bone marrow transplants between individuals who are matched for HLA are accepted. In immunocompetent recipients, most rejections of HLAmatched transplants occur because of recognition of minor histocompatibility antigens by individuals who have received multiple blood transfusions and are, as a result, sensitized against those antigens, which are not evaluated in tissue typing. For stem cell transplants, differences in minor histocompatibility antigens may lead to GVHD. Because HLA antigens are inherited in a codominant fashion, the preferred donor would be a relative, especially a sibling. Although the donor is not tested for minor histocompatibility antigens, the use of a close relative also would minimize differences at those loci. Chronic GVHD appears in 30% to 50% of transplants between HLAmatched siblings and in 60% to 70% of transplants between unrelated donors. Symptoms may appear about 4 to 7 months after the transplant, but may begin much earlier or later. Depletion of T cells from bone marrow before transplantation significantly lowers the incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD. One method of doing this is to infuse the graft with monoclonal antibody against plasma membrane antigens found only on mature T cells. Another method is to use fetal tissue as the graft. For example, fetal liver, which contains stem cells but not immunocompetent lymphocytes, is sometimes grafted in place of bone marrow if an HLA-matched donor cannot be found. Steroids are commonly used to suppress GVHD in recipients of bone marrow transplants performed to treat certain malignancies or primary immune deficiencies. In cases where steroids are ineffective, promising new data support the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Stem cells are relatively undifferentiated cells and can be obtained from a variety of sources (e.g., embryos, bone marrow, adult tissues). MSCs are present in all adult tissues. These particular stem cells undergo differentiation into other cell types and, more importantly, have potent immunosuppressive properties. Several recent clinical trials have demonstrated complete suppression of GVHD in a large number of recipients of MSCs. Reconstitution of thymic function can benefit individuals lacking a thymus or thymic function (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome, ataxiatelangiectasia, or chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis). The procedure involves transplantation of fetal thymic tissue, which lacks immunocompetent T cells, or thymic epithelial cells (the cells that produce the thymic hormones) from which mature T cells have been removed. In some individuals transplantation increases the number of circulating mature T cells, but in most cases improvement is only temporary. Enzymatic defects that cause SCID (e.g., adenosine deaminase deficiency) have been treated successfully with transfusions of glycerol frozen-packed erythrocytes. The donor erythrocytes contain the needed enzyme and can, at least temporarily, provide sufficient enzyme for normal lymphocyte function. An alternative method is administration of purified adenosine deaminase that has been stabilized with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Treatment with Soluble Immune Modulators The administration of soluble materials that affect lymphocyte function can restore T-cell function, especially in individuals with WAS or chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Successful for some individuals is the use of transfer factor, a low-molecular-weight nucleoprotein prepared from lymphocyte lysates, which can confer specific reactivity against certain antigens. Thymosin, a thymic hormone, also has been used, although with limited success. Cytokine therapy also has been effective in some cases of chronic granulomatous disease. Gene Therapy The first successful therapeutic replacement of defective genes was performed in two girls with SCID caused by an ADA deficiency.48 The normal gene for ADA was cloned and inserted into a retroviral vector.49 The gene for ADA replaced some retroviral genes, resulting in a virus that carried the normal human gene but was thought not to cause disease. The virus was used to infect bone marrow stem cells from these children. The retrovirus inserted the normal ADA gene into the individuals' genetic material. The genetically altered stem cells were infused into the children, resulting in partial reconstitution of their immune systems, although multiple treatments were needed and the need for infusion of packed erythrocytes was still required. However, retroviral-mediated gene therapy for other diseases, such as X-linked SCID, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and WiskottAldrich Syndrome (WAS), but not to treat ADA deficiency, resulted in the induction of leukemia.50 Current gene therapy using alternative modified viral vectors has alleviated those complications.51 New gene therapy trials using newly developed vectors have been performed for ADA deficiency, X-linked SCID, CGD, and WAS. The outcomes have significantly improved for ADA deficiency (100% survival) with most individuals gaining protective immunity and no complications related to viral vector.52 Gene therapy has become standard care for individuals without well-matched sibling donors for stem cell transplant. Summary Review Hypersensitivity: Allergy, Autoimmunity, and Alloimmunity 1. Inappropriate immune responses are misdirected responses against the host's own tissues (autoimmunity); directed responses against beneficial foreign tissues, such as transfusions or transplants (alloimmunity); exaggerated responses against environmental antigens (allergy); or insufficient responses to protect the host (immune deficiency). 2. Allergy, autoimmunity, and alloimmunity are collectively known as hypersensitivity reactions. 3. Mechanisms of hypersensitivity are classified as type I (IgEmediated) reactions, type II (tissue-specific) reactions, type III (immune complex–mediated) reactions, and type IV (cellmediated) reactions. 4. Hypersensitivity reactions can be immediate (developing within minutes to a few hours) or delayed (developing within several hours or days). 5. Anaphylaxis, the most rapid immediate hypersensitivity reaction, is an explosive reaction that occurs within minutes of reexposure to the antigen and can lead to cardiovascular shock. 6. Allergens are antigens that cause allergic responses. 7. Type I (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity reactions are mediated through the binding of IgE to Fc receptors on mast cells and cross-linking of IgE by antigens that bind to the Fab portions of IgE. Cross-linking causes mast cell degranulation and the release of histamine (the most potent mediator) and other inflammatory substances. 8. Histamine, acting through the H1 receptor, contracts bronchial smooth muscles, causing bronchial constriction; increases vascular permeability, causing edema; and causes vasodilation, increasing blood flow into the affected area. Histamine with H2 receptors results in increased gastric acid secretion and a decrease of histamine released from mast cells and basophils. 9. Histamine enhances the chemotaxis of eosinophils into sites of type I allergic reactions. 10. Atopic individuals tend to produce higher quantities of IgE and to have more Fc receptors for IgE on their mast cells. 11. Type II (tissue-specific) hypersensitivity reactions are caused by five possible mechanisms: complement-mediated lysis, opsonization and phagocytosis, neutrophil-mediated tissue damage, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and modulation of cellular function. 12. Type III (immune complex–mediated) hypersensitivity reactions are caused by the formation of immune complexes that are deposited in target tissues, where they activate the complement cascade, generating chemotactic fragments that attract neutrophils into the inflammatory site. Neutrophils release lysosomal enzymes that result in tissue damage. 13. Intermediate-sized immune complexes are the most likely to have severe pathologic consequences. 14. Immune complex disease can be a systemic reaction, such as serum sickness, or a localized response, such as the Arthus reaction. 15. Type IV (cell-mediated) hypersensitivity reactions are caused by either cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc cells) or lymphokineproducing Th1 cells. 16. Typical allergens include pollen, molds and fungi, certain foods (milk, eggs, fish, peanuts), animals, certain drugs, cigarette smoke, and house dust. 17. Clinical manifestations of allergic reactions usually are confined to the areas of initial intake or contact with the allergen. Ingested allergens induce gastrointestinal symptoms, airborne allergens induce respiratory tract or skin manifestations, and contact allergens induce allergic responses at the site of contact. 18. Autoimmune diseases originate from the coincidence of an initiating event in a genetically predisposed individual leading to an autoimmune mechanism that affects specific target tissues or cells. Central tolerance develops during the embryonic period. Peripheral tolerance is maintained in secondary lymphoid organs by regulatory T lymphocytes or antigen-presenting dendritic cells. 19. Autoimmune disease can be caused by the exposure of a previously sequestered antigen, the development of a neoantigen, the complications of infectious disease, the emergence of a forbidden clone of lymphocytes, or the consequence of ineffective peripheral tolerance. The mechanism for imitation of autoimmune diseases may already be within humans. 20. Alloimmunity is the immune system's reaction against antigens on the tissues of other members of the same species. 21. Alloimmune disorders include transient neonatal disease, in which the maternal immune system becomes sensitized against antigens expressed by the fetus; transplant rejection; and transfusion reactions, in which the immune system of the recipient of an organ transplant or blood transfusion reacts against foreign antigens on the donor's cells. 22. SLE is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory disease and is one of the most serious of the autoimmune disorders. SLE is characterized by the production of a large variety of autoantibodies. 23. Hyperacute graft rejection (preexisting antibody) is immediate and rare, acute rejection is cell mediated and occurs days to months after transplantation, and chronic rejection is caused by inflammatory damage to endothelial cells as a result of a weak cell-mediated reaction. 24. Red blood cell antigens may be the targets of autoimmune or alloimmune reactions. The most important of these, because they provoke the strongest humoral immune response, are the ABO and Rh systems. Deficiencies in Immunity 1. Disorders resulting from immune deficiency are the clinical sequelae of impaired function of components of the immune or inflammatory response, phagocytes, or complement. 2. Immune deficiency is the failure of mechanisms of self-defense to function in their normal capacity. 3. Immune deficiencies are either congenital (primary) or acquired (secondary). Primary immune deficiencies are caused by genetic defects that disrupt lymphocyte development, whereas secondary immune deficiencies are secondary to disease or other physiologic alterations. 4. The clinical hallmark of immune deficiency is a propensity to unusual or recurrent severe infections. The type of infection usually reflects the immune system defect. 5. The most common infections in individuals with defects of the cell-mediated immune response are fungal and viral, whereas infections in individuals with defects of the humoral immune response or complement function are primarily bacterial. 6. Defects in B-cell function are diverse, ranging from a complete lack of the human bursal equivalent function, the lymphoid organs required for B-cell maturation (as in Bruton agammaglobulinemia), to deficiencies in a single class of immunoglobulins (e.g., selective IgA deficiency). 7. DiGeorge syndrome (congenital thymic aplasia or hypoplasia) is characterized by complete or partial lack of the thymus (resulting in depressed T-cell immunity) and the parathyroid glands (resulting in hypocalcemia) and the presence of cardiac anomalies. 8. SCID is a total lack of T-cell function and a severe (either partial or total) lack of B-cell function. SCID can result from mutations in critical enzymes (ADA deficiency, PNP deficiency), in cytokine receptors (X-linked SCID, JAK3 deficiency, IL-7 receptor deficiency), or in antigen receptors (RAG-1/RAG-2 deficiencies, CD45 deficiency, CD3 deficiency, ZAP-70 deficiency). Other combined defects may result from deficiencies in antigen-presenting molecules (bare lymphocyte syndrome), cytoskeletal proteins (WAS), or DNA repair (ataxia-telangiectasia). 9. Almost any portion of the complement cascade may be defective. The most severe defect is C3 deficiency, which results in recurrent life-threatening bacterial infections. Defects in proteins of the membrane attack complex usually result in unusual disseminated infections with bacteria of the Neisseria spp. 10. Defects in phagocyte function, which include insufficient numbers of phagocytes or defects of chemotaxis, phagocytosis, or killing, can result in recurrent life-threatening infections such as septicemia and disseminated pyogenic lesions. 11. Autoinflammatory disorders are characterized by abnormally high levels of inflammation secondary to mutations in control of inflammasome activation or in defects in cellular receptors of cytokines designed to decrease inflammation. These disorders are frequently related to diminished control of infections of epithelial surfaces. Autoinflammatory disorders are characterized by abnormally high levels of inflammation secondary to mutations in control of inflammasome activation or in defects in cellular receptors of cytokines designed to decrease inflammation. These disorders are frequently related to diminished control of infections of epithelial surfaces. 12. Acquired immunodeficiencies are caused by superimposed conditions, such as aging, malnutrition, infections, malignancies, physical or psychologic trauma, environmental factors, some medical treatments, or other diseases. 13. Deficiencies in immunity usually are treated by replacement therapy. Deficient antibody production is treated by replacement of missing immunoglobulins with commercial gamma-globulin preparations. Lymphocyte deficiencies are treated with the replacement of host lymphocytes with transplants of bone marrow, fetal liver, or fetal thymus from a donor.

Modern public health initiatives, vaccination programs, and the use of antibiotics have greatly progressed prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. As a result of these initiatives, naturally occurring smallpox has been eradicated from the globe (the last reported case was in 1975 in Somalia), measles is almost eradicated in the Western Hemisphere, and many diseases, such as tuberculosis and polio, are on the decline. In the United States in 2014, influenza/pneumonia was the eighth and septicemia was the eleventh ranked cause of death in adults, and bacterial sepsis was the seventh leading cause of neonatal deaths.1 However, infectious disease remains a significant threat to life in many parts of the world, particularly in low income countries where prevention is less effective. In these countries 5 of the top 10 causes of death are attributable to infection: lower respiratory tract infections (#1), HIV/AIDS (#2), diarrheal diseases (#3), malaria (#6), and tuberculosis (#8). Infectious disease remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality because of the emergence of previously unknown infections, the reemergence and spread of old infections that were thought to be under control, and the development of infectious agents that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. The causes for these occurrences are numerous and include the following: • Vast and rapid urbanization in many areas of the world, resulting in a breakdown in public health programs and a more rapid spread of infection • Poverty and social inequality • War and famine • Global travel, allowing more rapid spread of disease from isolated areas to virtually any point around the world in a few hours • Human encroachment into wilderness areas, resulting in contact with previously sequestered infectious agents • Practice of prescribing antibiotics excessively or not taking antibiotics for a complete course of therapy; or, even when appropriately used, over administration of antibiotics facilitates the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms • Denial of a problem by governments, allowing infections to spread in an uncontrolled way • Diminished use of effective insecticides • Increased global warming, allowing insect vectors to spread into and breed in areas that were previously too cool for them Emerging Infections The emergence of previously unknown infections is not a new event in human history. However, the current rate may be unprecedented. Within 1 generation, more than 40 previously unknown infections have arisen. Some of these infections were harbored in animals and spread to humans with significant clinical impacts (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS-coronavirus] from bats, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] from dromedary camels).3 These are referred to as zoonotic infections. Zika virus also is an example of a recently emerging infection that has spread globally (see What's New? Zika Virus). Several have extremely high mortality rates of more than 50%, including SARS (in those older than 65 years), Ebola virus, Marburg virus, “mad cow” disease, Nipah virus (up to 75%), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (almost 100% in untreated persons). However, most either spread very slowly (e.g., AIDS) or initially appear in relatively isolated areas and are effectively controlled by quarantine (e.g., Ebola virus). Although none of these infections has developed into worldwide scourges, the potential of reversion to more rapidly spreading variants is a concern of public health agencies. In 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a list of emerging viral diseases that need urgent attention based on the probability of causing severe epidemics and the lack of medical countermeasures.4 These included MERS, SARS-coronavirus, Nipah virus, and hemorrhagic fevers associated with Ebola, Marburg virus, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, and Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever. What's New? Zika Virus The spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) is the most recent example of an infection emerging from a limited geographical region and rapidly becoming a global health risk of yet unknown impact. Extensive discussions of ZIKV can be found at numerous websites, particularly at those of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ZIKV was discovered in rhesus monkeys in 1947 in the Zika forest of Uganda and in 1948 in local mosquitoes. ZIKV is a member of the Flavivirus family, which includes West Nile virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. The principal vectors are Aedes aegypti and occasionally A. albopictus. One or both of these mosquitoes are distributed throughout most of the United States.1 The first human cases were found in Uganda and neighboring Tanzania in 1952 and in Nigeria in 1953. ZIKV was progressively detected in western Africa and southern Asia, but human infection was rare. In 2007 the first major outbreak occurred. On the island of Yap in Micronesia about 5000 individuals (73% of the population) were infected.2 Symptoms were relatively mild, and most individuals were asymptomatic. In 2008 the first case in the United States was reported. The number of sexually transmitted cases has progressively increased. ZIKV has been found in semen, sperm, and vaginal fluid and can be transmitted during virtually any kind of sexual activity.3 Semen contains infectious virus for up to 6 months after the onset of symptoms and is transmissible at any stage (i.e., before, during, and well after symptoms) or from an individual with a subclinical infection. ZIKV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or delivery. Transmission through breast-feeding has not been reported. ZIKV appears to be neurotropic (specifically infects neural tissue). Major fetal complications include miscarriage, fetal death, microcephaly, and ocular disorders. In asymptomatic pregnant women, the risk of microcephaly is relatively low (approximately 1%). In symptomatic women, the incidence is higher (some estimate as high as 29%). Congenital microcephaly presents as a significantly smaller head because of diminished cerebral cortex development and frequently results in early neonatal death.4 Adult complications are relatively few but also neurologic, primarily a postinfection Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) that occurs in about 2 of 10,000 individuals.5 GBS is a suspected autoimmune disorder of peripheral nerves leading to peripheral symptoms (e.g., weakness, tingling in the arms or legs, difficulty breathing, complete paralysis, and potentially death because of respiratory failure). The CDC has been closely monitoring ZIKV infections within the United States and U.S. territories. As of September 6 2017, the CDC has reported 231 symptomatic cases in the United States and 554 cases in U.S. territories.6 Very few alternatives are available to limit the spread of ZIKV and attempts to eradicate the vector by destruction of breeding sites are the most effective approach. Prevention includes limiting travel to sites where ZIKV is endemic preventing access of mosquitoes to homes, using insect repellents on exposed skin, and wearing clothing that covers most of the body surfaces in ZIKV-infected areas.

At least 20 previously known infections have reemerged including a new strains of cholera, malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, diptheria, plague, and Marburg virus. The incidence of tuberculosis has risen by almost 33% between the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Although the United States is relatively free of most of these diseases, the effects of global warming and relaxed control of vectors may result in resurgence. West Nile virus, spread by mosquitoes, has spread throughout the continental United States, Canada, and Mexico.5 Many common infections previously controlled by antibiotics or vaccination have reemerged because of antibiotic resistance or secondary to decreased compliance with recommended vaccinations. Examples of these infections include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, malaria, meningitis, respiratory tract infections, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Additionally, noncompliance with recommended vaccinations has led to outbreaks of diseases that were once under control (e.g., measles and pertussis). Added to this collage of microbiologic dangers is the rising risk of bioterrorism. Agents such as smallpox, anthrax, and plague are continuing threats to public health and safety. Microorganisms and Humans: a Dynamic Relationship For many microorganisms the human body is a hospitable site in which to grow and flourish because of sufficient nutrients and appropriate conditions of temperature and humidity. Frequently, a symbiotic relationship exists, in which both humans and microorganisms benefit (Box 10.1). These microorganisms make up the normal microbiome—the resident microorganisms found in different parts of the body, including the skin, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and genital tract (see Chapter 7). For instance, the normal bacterial microbiome of the human gut is provided with nutrients from ingested food, produces enzymes that facilitate the digestion and use of many of the more complex molecules found in the human diet, produces antibacterial factors (e.g., bacteriocins, colicins) that prevent colonization by pathogenic microorganisms, and produces usable metabolites (e.g., vitamin K, B vitamins). This beneficial homeostasis is normally maintained through the physical integrity of the gut and other mechanisms that sequester these microorganisms on the mucosal surface. Box 10.1 The Many Relationships Between Humans and Microorganisms Symbiosis: Benefits only the human; no harm to the microorganism Mutualism: Benefits the human and the microorganism Commensalism: Benefits only the microorganism; no harm to the human Pathogenicity: Benefits the microorganism; harms the human Opportunism: A situation in which benign microorganisms become pathogenic because of decreased human host resistance Microorganisms and Infections Clinical Infectious Disease Microorganisms are generally classified based on different morphologic characteristics and life cycles. However, groups of disease-causing microorganisms share many properties related to clinical disease, processes of infection, and evasion of human protective systems. The clinical process of infection occurs in the following four distinct stages: • Incubation period—the period from initial exposure to the infectious agent and the onset of the first symptoms, during which the microorganisms have entered the individual, undergone initial colonization, and begun multiplying, but are at insufficient numbers to cause symptoms; this period may last from several hours to years • Prodromal stage—the occurrence of initial symptoms, which are often very mild and include a feeling of discomfort and tiredness • Invasion period—the pathogen is multiplying rapidly, invading farther and affecting the tissues at the site of initial colonization as well as other areas; the immune and inflammatory responses have been triggered; symptoms may be specifically related to the pathogen or to the inflammatory response • Convalescence—in most instances, the individual's immune and inflammatory systems successfully remove the infectious agent and symptoms decline; alternatively, the disease may be fatal or may enter a latency phase with resolution of symptoms until reactivation at a later time Clinical manifestations of infectious disease vary depending on the pathogen, the organ system affected, and the intensity of the inflammatory response. The disease may be clinical (measurable infection-related symptoms) or subclinical (no apparent symptoms although the individual is infected). Effects of infection may be acute or chronic, secondary to the immune and inflammatory responses, or a direct consequence of toxins or injury to infected cells. The initial symptoms are typically fatigue, malaise, weakness, and loss of concentration. Generalized aching and loss of appetite are common complaints. However, the hallmark of most infectious diseases is fever. Fever is not failure of the body to regulate temperature; rather, body temperature is being regulated to a higher level than normal. The hypothalamus functions as a central thermostat and regulates temperature (see Chapter 16). Pyrogens are agents that can produce fever. Those derived from outside the host are termed exogenous pyrogens and those produced by the individual's inflammatory response are termed endogenous pyrogens. Exogenous pyrogens indirectly affect the hypothalamus through the release of endogenous pyrogens by cells of the host. A number of cytokines have been identified as endogenous pyrogens: interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 (IL-1 and IL-6), interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and others (see Fig. 16.8). These cytokines raise the thermoregulatory set point through stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis in both thermoregulatory (brain) and nonthermoregulatory (peripheral) tissue. Fever is considered a beneficial adaptive host-defense response in infection (e.g., killing of temperature-sensitive microorganisms). Several factors influence the capacity of a microorganism to cause disease: • Communicability: the ability to spread from one individual to others and cause disease (measles and pertussis spread very easily; HIV is of lower communicability) • Immunogenicity: the ability to induce an immune response • Infectivity: the ability to invade and multiply in the host • Mechanism of action: how the microorganism damages tissue • Pathogenicity: the ability to produce disease— success depends on communicability, infectivity, extent of tissue damage, and virulence • Portal of entry: the route by which a microorganism infects the host (e.g., direct contact, inhalation, ingestion, or bites of an animal or insect) • Toxigenicity: the ability to produce soluble toxins or endotoxins, factors that greatly influence the degree of virulence • Virulence: the capacity to cause severe disease, for example, measles virus is of low virulence; rabies virus is highly virulent Infectious diseases also are classified by their prevalence and spread within the community: • Endemic: diseases with relatively high but constant rates of infection in a particular population • Epidemic: the number of new infections in a particular population greatly exceeds the number usually observed • Pandemic: an epidemic that spreads over a large area, such as a continent or worldwide (see Table E 10.1 on Evolve) As a consequence of the relative severity of clinical infection and the ability to successfully treat the infection, some infections are considered relatively minor inconveniencies, such as the common cold, and others have a major impact because of severe morbidity and mortality. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed a National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.6 An evolving list of notifiable infectious diseases is maintained to monitor, control, and prevent the spread of disease. STIs are among the most common reportable diseases in 2015: Chlamydia (>1.5 million cases), gonorrhea (about 400,000 cases), HIV (>33,000 cases), and syphilis (>23,000 cases). Process of Infection The process of infection includes colonization, invasion, multiplication, and dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms. Many potentially pathogenic microorganisms reside within the normal microbiome without causing severe disease. The symbiotic relationship with the normal flora is maintained by physical barriers (e.g., skin and lining of respiratory and intestinal tracts), the complexity of the microbiome, and inflammatory and immune systems. Microorganisms that may cause infection if the protective barriers or defensive systems are weakened are referred to as opportunistic microorganisms. Physical damage to the intestinal tract during trauma or surgery releases intestinal bacteria into the bloodstream, potentially leading to sepsis, shock, and death. Cuts in the skin may allow normally contained bacteria (e.g., S. aureus) to cause local infections (e.g., abscesses, boils) and invade further and infect various organs. Alterations in the microbiome by antibiotics may allow local overgrowth of opportunistic microorganisms (e.g., Clostridium difficile, Candida albicans). Immune deficiencies may allow invasive systemic infections (e.g., systemic fungal infections) (see Chapter 9). Unlike opportunistic infectious agents, true pathogens have devised means to circumvent the individual's defenses (discussed in Chapters 7 and 8) and cause infection. Infection with these agents is usually dependent on adequate numbers of microorganisms rather than compromise of the host's defenses. The estimated minimum number of microorganisms needed to cause infection (minimum infective dose) varies greatly with the particular pathogen: Vibrio cholerae (103 to 108 microorganisms), norovirus and rotavirus (10–100), Giardia lamblia parasitic diarrhea (10), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (<10). Pathogenic microorganisms usually exist in reservoirs (a natural habitat where the microorganism can multiply), such as the environment (e.g., contaminated water, soil), vertebrate animals, or another human who is infected. An individual may obtain an infectious microorganism from a reservoir either directly or indirectly. Direct transmission may occur through direct contact with infections of another individual, such as the skin lesions of impetigo (S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes), fungal skin infections (athlete's foot), scabies (mites), lice (head or body lice), oral herpes, and STIs (see Chapter 27). Vertical transmission is the spread of microorganisms from mother to child across the placenta (e.g., T. pallidum, Listeria monocytogenes, cytomegalovirus [CMV], Toxoplasma gondii), ascending the birth canal from vaginal colonization or during delivery (e.g., group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, hepatitis B virus, HIV, C. albicans), or through the breast milk (e.g., S. aureus, HIV). Spread of microorganisms from one person to another is horizontal transmission. Indirect transmission occurs from contact with contaminated materials, which can range from towels to food or through a vector. Transmission by indirect physical contact may occur with materials that the infected individual came in contact (e.g., towels, sheets, clothing, toys, bandages) and is a common route of transmission for S. aureus. Iatrogenic transmission occurs inadvertently as a result of medical procedures, such as contaminated transfusions, transplants, implants, and catheters. Many infectious microorganisms are transmitted on the surface of objects that penetrate the skin or from dirt that contaminates wounds, such as spores of Clostridium perfringens (gas gangrene) and C. tetani (tetanus). Respiratory transmission may occur by means of several mechanisms. Coughing or sneezing generally creates a mist that can be inhaled from the air for considerable time. This mechanism readily transmits many viral diseases, including the common cold, influenza, mumps, and measles. Infected individuals also may produce airborne droplets that settle on environmental surfaces. Several viral and bacterial diseases may be spread in this manner, including pertussis, influenza, pneumonia, legionnaires disease, and rubella. Other microorganisms may be airborne by circulating air that carries microorganisms picked up from the soil, dried droppings, or other sites. Most pathogenic fungi (e.g., Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatitidis) grow as saprophytes in the environment and are transmitted by inhalation of spores and initially present as pulmonary infections but may spread to other sites in the body. Many ingested substances (food, water) may be contaminated by minuscule amounts of human feces (fecal-oral transmission) that transmits Salmonella (salmonella food poisoning), cholera, hepatitis A virus, poliovirus, rotavirus, norovirus, Giardia lamblia, and many others that cause minor or major gastrointestinal diseases. Zoonotic infections may be directly transmitted from animals, such as transmission of the rabies virus through bites. Most zoonotic infections are transmitted indirectly by means of vector-borne transmission (primarily insects). Mechanical vectors (e.g., housefly) passively transfer parasitic, bacterial, fungal, or viral microorganisms on the outside of their body from contaminated material to an individual. Biologic vectors (e.g., insects [arthropods]) feed off the blood of infected individuals. The infectious agent usually undergoes part of its life cycle within the arthropod, including multiplication, and is transmitted through bites or stings. Biologic vectors are responsible for some of the most severe blood-borne diseases. Important arthropods include mosquitoes (spreads malaria [Plasmodium spp.], arboviruses [arthropod-borne viruses], dengue hemorrhagic fever), tsetse fly (spreads trypanosomes such as Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease in South America, and T. brucei, which causes sleeping sickness in Africa), fleas (plague [Yersinia pestis], typhus [Rickettsia prowazekii], leishmaniasis [protozoan parasite Leishmania spp.]), and deer tick (Lyme disease [Borrelia burgdorferi]). During transmission successful pathogens usually undergo initial adherence to tissue at the site of entrance to the body. Several produce localized infections without tissue invasion (e.g., V. cholera in the intestinal tract), whereas others require spread from the initial site of colonization. Colonization begins when the microorganism stabilizes adherence to tissue through specific surface receptors. Adherence helps protect the microorganism from removal by mechanical, nonspecific forces, such as coughing of respiratory mucus. Adherence occurs between ligands/receptors on the microorganism and on the surface of cells, the specificity of which results in localization of an infectious agent to particular sites (tissue tropism), such as the confinement of common cold viruses to the respiratory tract. Although discussions of infectious diseases generally focus on single microorganisms that can be isolated and identified, they frequently exist in the body as part of complex multicellular masses called biofilms.7 Biofilms consist of mixed species of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, immersed in a highly organized extracellular matrix produced by the microorganisms. Growth in biofilms offers survival advantages of protection by trapping components of the host's defenses and antibiotics.8 The closely organized structure allows for exchange of genetic information for antibiotic resistance and other defense mechanisms. Biofilms form on implanted medical devises (e.g., catheters, pacemakers, implanted heart valves, prosthetic joints, dentures) and are associated with chronic infections (e.g., persistent nasopharyngeal colonization with staphylococci; otitis media; diabetes-associated foot ulcers; infected burns; vaginitis; osteomyelitis; pneumonia secondary to cystic fibrosis; diseases of the oral cavity related to dental plaque, such as dental caries and periodontitis). Invasion follows colonization. Successful infectious agents have developed mechanisms to penetrate the tissues and evade the host's nonspecific and specific defenses (inflammation and immunity). The process of invasion is closely linked to tissue damage. Extracellular pathogens generally invade by means of direct extension into the surrounding tissue and access to the lymphatics and bloodstream, from which they spread to internal organs. This form of invasion requires a variety of virulence factors, including adhesion molecules and toxins, which may directly lead to tissue damage. Obligate intracellular pathogens, such as intracellular bacteria, parasites, and viruses, spread directly from cell to cell or by release of infectious microorganisms into extracellular fluid or blood from which they infect another cell. Some intracellular microorganisms may enter a latency phase within infected cells without spread or cellular damage until reactivation of the microbe occurs (e.g., herpes simplex virus, CMV, tuberculosis). The presence of infectious microorganisms in the blood is generally referred to as bacteremia (bacteria in blood), viremia (viruses in blood), or fungemia (fungi in blood) and is usually related to transport and spread to other organs. Septicemia is multiplication of microorganisms (particularly bacteria) in the blood. Classes of Infectious Microorganisms Infectious disease can be caused by microorganisms that range in size from 20 nm (poliovirus) to 10 m (tapeworm). Classes of pathogenic microorganisms and their characteristics are summarized in Table 10.1 and discussed in detail in the following sections. TABLE 10.1 CLASSES OF MICROORGANISMS INFECTIOUS TO HUMANS CLASS SIZE SITE OF REPRODUCTION EXAMPLE Bacteria 0.8–15 mcg Skin Staphylococcal wound infection Mucous membranes Cholera Extracellular Streptococcal pneumonia Intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis Chlamydiae 200–1000 nm Intracellular Urethritis Rickettsiae 300–1200 nm Intracellular Rocky Mountain spotted fever Mycoplasma 125–350 nm Extracellular Atypical pneumonia 2–200 mcg Skin Tinea pedis (athlete's foot) Mucous membranes Candida (e.g., thrush) Extracellular Sporotrichosis Intracellular Histoplasmosis Fungi Protozoa Helminths Virus 1–50 mm 3 mm–10 m 20–300 nm Mucosal Giardiasis Extracellular Sleeping sickness Intracellular Trichinosis Extracellular Filariasis Intracellular Poliomyelitis Infectious Bacteria Bacteria are prokaryotic unicellular microorganisms with no nuclei, mitochondria, or membrane-bound organelles. They are generally divided into several groups: • True bacteria divide by binary fission and may have a variety of morphologies, including cocci (spherical), bacilli (rod shaped), vibrios (commashaped rods), or spirilla (twisted, rod shaped). Most disease-causing bacteria fall into this classification. • Filamentous bacteria may have branching, mycelium-like structures that resemble fungi. Examples include Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae that respectively cause tuberculosis and leprosy. • Spirochetes are flexible spiral filaments that are motile and most are anaerobic. Pertinent examples include Borrelia recurrentis (relapsing fever), Treponema pallidum (syphilis), and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease). • Mycoplasma lack a rigid cell wall and are small and pleomorphic. They are the smallest and simplest members of the bacteria. Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes atypical pneumonia, and Mycoplasma genitalium is a suspected cause of urethritis and pelvic inflammatory disease. • Rickettsia are strict intracellular parasites that can be rod-shaped, spherical, or pleomorphic. They are typically spread by insect vectors and cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii) and typhus (R. prowazekii). • Chlamydia are also strict intracellular parasites, but with more complex intracellular life cycles. The primary chlamydial pathogen is Chlamydia trachomatis, which causes the most common bacterial STI (pelvic inflammatory disease) and eye infections (conjunctivitis). Bacteria also can be categorized as gram negative or gram positive. Gram-negative bacteria do not retain crystal violet dye in the Gramstaining process whereas gram-positive bacteria do retain crystal violet dye. Gram-negative bacteria also have a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) coat in the outer membrane, which consists of lipid A, a core polysaccharide, and O antigen. The LPS coat also is known as endotoxin (Fig. 10.1). Common bacterial pathogens are listed in Table 10.2. FIGURE 10.1 Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria. A, The structure of the bacterial cell wall determines its staining characteristics with Gram stain. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick layer of peptidoglycan (left). Gram-negative bacteria have a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (right).

Many bacteria have specialized surface structures that contribute to the structural integrity of biofilms and provide adherence to cells and tissue during invasion. Pili (also called fimbriae) are thin, rodlike projections from the bacterial surface9 (Fig. 10.2). Pathogenic strains of E. coli involved in urinary tract infections have a variety of different specific pili-associated adhesion molecules (i.e., adhesins), including mannose-binding protein that binds with glycoproteins specifically expressed on the bladder epithelium. FIGURE 10.2 Attachment of Escherichia coli through Pili. A, Transmission electron micrograph showing pili (arrows) of pathogenic E. coli. B, Scanning electron micrograph of E. coli (orange) attached by pili (arrows) to bladder epithelium (blue). (A courtesy Eric Buckles and Paula J. Fernandes; B modified from Wein A et al: Campbell-Walsh urology, ed 9, Philadelphia, 2007, Saunders.) Flagella (used for bacterial motion) also express adhesins. Vibrio cholerae expresses adhesins for fibronectin, a common component of mucosal cell surfaces. Adhesion to connective tissue components, such as fibronectin (S. pyogenes [group A streptococci], S. aureus, T. pallidum), collagen, laminin, and vitronectin are common sites of bacterial adherence. Several microorganisms use complement-related receptors for initial attachment. Neisseria spp. adhere to urinary tract epithelial cell membrane–associated cofactor protein (CD46), which is a complement-regulatory protein that protects cells by inactivating C3b and C4b. Others use different components of the CR3-C3b/C3bi receptor-ligand system on the surface of monocytes/macrophages for adherence including Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila (legionnaires disease), and M. tuberculosis. Toxins and Bacterial Products. Bacterial pathogens produce a variety of toxic molecules that may kill the individual's cells, disrupt the tissue, and protect against inflammation. Exotoxins are proteins released during microbial growth and they may have specific or broad effects on connective tissue and cells. Exotoxins are classified by their mode of action. Type I toxins bind to the cell surface and alter cell function, type II toxins cause membrane damage, and type III toxins enter the cell. Type I toxins include superantigens and heat-stable enterotoxins (i.e., toxins that target the intestinal tract). Superantigens (SAgs) (discussed in Chapter 8) are molecules that react with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and the T-cell receptor (TCR), independent of the specificity of the TCR. SAgs activate many more cells than a specific antigen would and lead to overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL1, IL-6, and TNF-α. SAgs are responsible for several diseases, including food poisoning (heat-stable enterotoxins of S. aureus and C. perfringens), toxic shock syndrome (toxic shock syndrome toxin [TSST] of S. aureus), and scarlet fever (erythrogenic toxin of S. pyogenes). E. coli secretes small-molecular-weight heat-stable enterotoxins that bind to membrane-bound guanylate cyclase, resulting in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and loss of cellular electrolytes and water. Type II toxins are membrane-damaging molecules of several subtypes. Cholesterol-dependent toxins are cytolytic. They bind to the cell surface and assemble to construct an extremely large pore, similar to C9 of the complement system and perforin produced by T-cytotoxic cells10 (see Chapters 7 and 8). Cholesterol is required for formation of the pore. The pore leads to rapid exchange of calcium and water and cell death. S. pneumoniae secretes the cholesterol-dependent toxin pneumolysin, which can facilitate colonization of the lungs as well as protect the bacteria from macrophages. Type II toxins also include a subtype called RTX cytotoxins, which contain repeats in protein sequence. An example is α-hemolysin from E. coli. The α-hemolysin is a virulence factor that predominantly causes urinary tract infection and lysis of erythrocytes as a source of nutrients, but also protects E. coli by lysis of macrophages and lymphocytes. A third subtype of type II toxins includes enzymatically active toxins. C. perfringens, found in soil and as a wound contaminant, is the cause of gas gangrene. The major virulence factor is an α-toxin with phospholipase activity that results in hemolysis, as well as hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids of other cells. Type III toxins are generally A-B toxins and the most common bacterial toxin. A-B toxins are referred to as binary toxins because two different components are required for activity: separately secreted A (active) and B (binding) components. The B components are activated by proteases either in the extracellular fluid or on the surface membrane of the target cell. Multiple activated B components organize on the cell membrane to form a complex with which A components bind for transportation into the cell. Overgrowth of C. difficile in the colon is a common complication of prolonged antibiotic therapy that kills much of the commensal microbiome. C. difficile secretes membrane-disrupting toxins A (an enterotoxin) and B (a cytotoxin) that damage the mucosa and result in watery diarrhea and potentially life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis.11 Clostridium botulinum produces the most potent toxin known, botulinum toxin, which is a paralytic neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine at nerve-muscle synapses and results in flaccid paralysis and death. Examples of A-B toxins include botulinum, tetanospasmin, Corynebacterium diptheriae (diptheria cytotoxin), P. aeruginosa (exotoxin A), and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax toxin). A subset of A-B toxins is AB5 toxins, examples of which are B. pertussis (pertussis toxin), S. dysenteriae (Shiga toxin), and V. cholerae (cholera heat-labile enterotoxin). AB5 toxins form a complex of an A component noncovalently bound in a ring of five B components. During endocytosis, the A component is activated and alters cellular function usually by inactivating signaling pathways, increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), or other means. The A component of anthrax A-B toxin is a zincmetalloproteinase that prevents intracellular signaling. Diphtheria is a respiratory tract infection with systemic complications caused by an A-B toxin that inhibits messenger RNA (mRNA) translation and causes low blood pressure, necrosis in the heart and liver, degeneration of myelin sheaths, and death. The AB5 cholera toxin leads to increased adenylate cyclase activity, which affects chloride channels, causing an efflux of chloride, water, and other salts into the intestinal lumen. Shiga toxin, another AB5 toxin, binds to carbohydrates on the cell surface of the endothelium of the intestine, kidney, and brain. Shiga toxin is secreted by several pathogens, including E. coli O157:H7, a contaminant of food or water. Ingestion of Shiga toxin may initially cause bloody diarrhea followed by hemolytic uremic syndrome (hemolytic anemia, acute kidney failure, thrombocytopenia), which is especially severe and fatal in children.12 Another type of toxin is endotoxin. Unlike secreted exotoxins, endotoxin (also called lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) is contained in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria and is released during lysis (or destruction) of the bacteria (see Fig. 10.1). The innermost part of LPS, lipid A, is made of polysaccharides and fatty acids and is responsible for the substance's toxic effects. Endotoxin also may be released during bacterial growth or during treatment with antibiotics. Therefore antibiotics cannot prevent the effects of the endotoxin. The release of a sufficient amount of endotoxin can lead to fatal endotoxic shock (septic shock), which is one of the leading causes of death in intensive care units. Bacteria that produce endotoxins are called pyrogenic bacteria because they stimulate the release of inflammatory mediators that produce fever and cause the local and systemic effects of inflammation (Fig. 10.3). Once in the blood, endotoxins cause the release of vasoactive peptides and cytokines that affect blood vessels, producing vasodilation, which reduces blood pressure; causes decreased oxygen delivery; and produces subsequent cardiovascular shock (see Chapter 49). Endotoxin can activate the coagulation cascade, leading to the syndrome of disseminated (or diffuse) intravascular coagulation (see Chapter 29). Additionally, endotoxin induces the release of TNF-α by macrophages. TNF is a potent proinflammatory cytokine, also called cachectin because of its role in promoting cachexia (wasting syndrome) in individuals with cancer. (Cachexia is discussed in Chapter 12; cytokines are discussed in Chapters 7 and 8.) FIGURE 10.3 The Many Activities of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Bacterial endotoxin (LPS) activates almost every aspect of inflammation. The release of LPS from gram-negative bacteria triggers successive waves of cytokine production, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8), and secondary mediators of inflammation, such as nitric oxide (NO) and platelet-activating factor (PAF). At low levels of LPS the effect is local. Moderate levels of LPS cause more systemic inflammatory responses. High levels of LPS may lead to septic shock and death. ARDS, Acute respiratory distress syndrome; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation. (From Kumar V, Abbas A, Fausto N: Robbins & Cotran pathologic basis of disease, ed 7, Philadelphia, 2005, Saunders; Modified from Abbas AK et al: Cellular and molecular immunology, ed 4, Philadelphia, 2000, WB Saunders.) In addition to toxins, bacteria can also release enzymes that promote infection. The enzymes are not specific for any particular cell or cell receptor, but facilitate spread of the microorganism and are sometimes called invasins. A secondary effect may be considerable damage to the tissues and organs. The site of infection contains a broad spectrum of proteases, lipases, deoxyribonucleases (DNases), and other enzymes secreted by microorganisms. The secretion of most toxic enzymes is common to broad groups of pathogens, whereas others discussed here are more limited to particular strains. Some proteases contribute to the defense against the immune and inflammatory systems by digesting components of the plasma systems (complement, clotting, fibrinolysis), immunoglobulins, cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides. Most also will weaken the surrounding connective tissue to allow invasion. Connective tissue is vulnerable to digestion by proteases that break down hyaluronic acid, collagen, fibrin, elastin, laminin, and glycosaminoglycans. Hyaluronidase is frequently produced by streptococci, staphylococci, and clostridia to break down hyaluronic acid polymers in the matrix. Collagenase is a product of several clostridia, breaking down the intercellular matrix in muscle during gangrene. Neuraminidase is especially useful for intestinal pathogens, such as V. cholerae and S. dysenteriae, degrading the sialic acid that strengthens the intestinal epithelial junctions. Kinases, such as streptokinase and staphylokinase, activate plasminogen to digest large clots that interfere with bacterial spread. Many enzymes also will digest membranes of tissue cells leading to lysis and release of nutrients that are useful to the microorganisms. Some hemolysins (those that lyse erythrocytes) or leukocidins (those that lyse phagocytes) are pore-forming toxins, but others are enzymes (e.g., lecithinases or phospholipases) that digest lipids in the membrane, resulting in hemolysis or cell death. C. perfringens produces phospholipases and lecithinases that remove the polar head groups from cell membrane phospholipids or destroy phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) in the membranes of most cells. Several enzymes perform a secondary role in invasion as adhesins to matrix components.13 Yersinia pestis (plague) expresses a plasminogen activator protease that can activate plasminogen to plasmin, which can dissolve clots and activate collagenase. When expressed on the bacterial surface, it binds strongly to laminin in the matrix and facilitates invasion. S. agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) produces a serine protease, a C5a peptidase, that degrades the chemotactic factor C5a, but also has a high binding affinity for fibronectin. Destructive Immune and Inflammatory Responses to Bacterial Infection. Much of the tissue damage caused by infections is secondary to the inflammatory and immune responses. Infectious microorganisms routinely initiate an immune and inflammatory response, including infiltrates of phagocytic cells and a wide variety of T cells, production of antibody, and activation of plasma systems (complement, clotting) (see Chapters 7, 8, and 9). Some are specific to antigens (T cells, antibodies) expressed by the microorganism, whereas others are not antigen-specific (phagoytes). Cytokines and chemokines secreted by inflammatory and immune cells are designed to inhibit the proliferation and spread of infectious agents; however, most also are damaging to the surrounding tissue. Antibodies will react with antigens expressed by the microorganism. Overproduction of antigen released as soluble molecules will lead to reaction with antibody and formation of immune complexes in the circulation or in tissue and activation of inflammatory systems. Because the antigen is from an exogenous source, the mechanism of tissue destruction would be classified as allergic and would be type II if expressed on the cell surface or type III if immune complexes are in the circulation (see Chapter 9). For example, individuals infected with S. pyogenes or T. palladium are at risk for developing symptoms of type III hypersensitivity reactions including kidney disease and vascular inflammation. The typical immune and inflammatory reaction against intracellular microorganisms or persistent infections involves a cell-mediated response with infiltration of T cells and macrophages, as well as neutrophils. The inflammatory site is rich in proinflammatory cytokines and as the individual's response increases so do the destructive effects on surrounding healthy tissue. Many of these infections are very difficult to eradicate, leading to progressively increasing production of cytokines. Persistent infections (e.g., M. tuberculosis) may lead to formation of granulomas, which cause further destruction of the infected organ (e.g., the lung). Bacterial Evasion of Immune and Inflammatory Systems. Evasion of the individual's immune and inflammatory systems is multifaceted, and the most successful pathogens incorporate several mechanisms (Table 10.3). TABLE 10.3 MECHANISMS USED BY MICROORGANISMS TO DEFEND AGAINST INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNITY STRATEGY BACTERIA FUNGI PARASITES VIRUSES Rapid division Initial proliferation in protective environment NA NA Rapid proliferation of viruses with small genomes Protection Intracellular bacteria Multiplication in against block granule phagosomes, phagocytosis fusion, survive in inhibition of and phagolysosomes, lysosomal intracellular enter and enzymes. destruction multiply in Polysaccharide cytoplasm. capsule, toxins Capsules with that inhibit antiphagocytic phagocytosis. and anticomplement activities, toxins to kill phagocytes (e.g., α-toxin and leukocidin).

IgA, Immunoglobulin A; IgG, immunoglobulin G; NA, not applicable;Th, T helper cell. Rapid Progression. Rapid progression is an evasive mechanism limited to bacteria and viruses. Because the primary immune response may take 3 to 5 days to reach protective levels, some pathogens proliferate at rates that surpass the development of the immune system. An example is V. cholerae, that causes severe vomiting and watery diarrhea, which has a 60% mortality rate and develops within 2 to 3 days of ingestion of the bacteria. Bacterial Protection Against Phagocytosis and Intracellular Destruction. Antiphagocytic capsules are expressed by most bacterial pathogens involved in pneumonia and meningitis (Fig. 10.4). Capsules are mostly polysaccharide, although proteins also may be capsular components. Examples include the thick polysaccharide covering of the pneumococcus (S. pneumoniae), the waxy capsule surrounding the tubercle bacillus (M. tuberculosis), the polysaccharide “slime” capsule of P. aeruginosa, and the M protein of S. pyogenes. FIGURE 10.4 Bacterial Capsule. Gram stain of a sputum sample from an individual with pneumococcal pneumonia (×1000 magnification). The sputum is rich in polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells and slightly elongated, gram-negative cocci (Streptococcus pneumoniae). Clear areas (arrows) around the bacteria indicate capsules. (Modified from Mandell G, Bennett J, Dolin R: Principles and practice of infectious diseases, ed 7, Philadelphia, 2010, Churchill Livingstone.) Some bacterial toxins and extracellular enzymes kill phagocytic cells (e.g., P. aeruginosa exotoxin A). Staphylococcal hemolysins and toxins from B. anthracis and B. pertussis decrease phagocytic and chemotactic activities and may be toxic to the cell. Streptococcal products, such as streptolysin O, bind to cholesterol in the membrane of the phagolysosome and initiate destruction through the cytoplasmic release of lysosomal enzymes. Normally a macrophage would efficiently kill bacteria, but mechanisms for intracellular survival have evolved to the benefit of the infectious agent. Intracellular bacteria can survive and even multiply in macrophages (Brucella, Listeria, M. leprae, M. tuberculosis) or in other cells. Bacterial killing results from fusion of lysosomal granules with the phagosome to produce a phagolysosome and activation of oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms. M. tuberculosis produces toxins that prevent phagosomelysosome fusion so that the environment in the phagosome remains relatively nontoxic. A second means of avoiding killing is neutralization of the toxic environment of the phagolysosome. Production of catalase and superoxide dismutase (N. gonorrhoeae, Brucella abortus) destroys toxic oxygen products produced by the hexose-monophosphate shunt. A third means of avoiding killing is escape from the phagosome. Lysins (e.g., hemolysin of Shigella, listeriolysin O and phospholipase C of L. monocytogenes, phospholipase A of Rickettsia spp.) are secreted enzymes that break down the phagosome membrane, releasing the bacteria into the cytoplasm where they multiply.14 Blocking Recognition of Bacterial Antigens. Pathogens that coat themselves with human proteins may “fool” the immune system by masking antigens. Some bacterial surface proteins (e.g., protein G of S. pyogenes) bind the Fc portion of antibody, thus forming a protective coat of “self” protein. Binding through the Fc holds the antibody in an orientation that does not allow complement activation or phagocytosis. T. pallidum coats itself with fibronectin. Capsules may contain sialic acid (e.g., E. coli K-12), which closely resembles the sialic acid on the surface of most human cells, or hyaluronic acid (e.g., group A streptococci), which is the basic substance in normal connective tissue. Antigenic variation allows the pathogen to alter surface antigens that are the targets of protective immune responses. Thus as the individual develops protective levels of antibodies, the pathogen responds by changing antigens and becoming resistant. The three primary mechanisms of antigenic variation are mutation (a change or error in gene structure that results in variant expression of antigen); recombination (the exchange of DNA fragments between cells resulting in a new DNA sequence and variance of antigen expression); and gene switching (the switching of genes on and off resulting in variation of antigen expression). Neisseria use pili to adhere to epithelium, and antibody against these antigens can abrogate adherence. Neisseria undergoes phase shifts during which pilar antigens are changed by progressive silencing of 1 set of 10 or 11 available pili genes and activation of others that express different antigens. Many bacteria have a large number of different antigenic types (serotypes) across the species. At least 80 different strains of group A streptococci express different serotypes of the capsular M protein. S. pneumoniae has at least 100 different serotypes based on capsular polysaccharides. Some gram-negative bacteria can revert to “rough” forms in which serotype-specific carbohydrates are deleted, thus becoming resistant to antibody and activation of complement. Blocking the Immune Response to Bacteria. Bacteria may spontaneously release surface molecules that bind to and neutralize antibody. These include endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria and capsular antigens from S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis. The secretion of large amounts of soluble antigen may lead to formation of immune complexes. Bacteria may break down molecules of the immune or inflammatory system. An IgA protease produced by meningitiscausing microorganisms and other related bacteria (N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae) cleaves IgA at the hinge region into ineffective Fc and Fab′2 regions. Salmonella membrane protease degrades nonspecific antimicrobial molecules like defensins and cathelicidins. Complement is a major component of the defense against bacterial infection through production of opsonin (C3b) and chemotactic factors (C3a, C5a) for neutrophils. Teichoic acid in the gram-positive cell wall provides resistance against complement-mediated lysis. Bacterial regulatory proteins (e.g., Borrelia complement-regulator-acquiring protein, Neisseria porins, and members of the Streptococcus M protein family) affect complement activation, including destabilization of the C3 convertase complex or degradation of the opsonin C3b.15 Pseudomonas produces elastase (breaks down C3 of the complement system) and a 56-kDa protease (breaks down the chemotactic factor C5a). Some bacterial pathogens can broadly suppress immune responses against their own antigens, as well as other antigens unrelated to the infectious agent. Chronic bacterial infections, like leprosy (M. leprae) and tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), induce anergy (suppressed response to multiple antigens) in infected hosts. Helicobacter pylori releases LPS that binds to dendritic cells and blocks development of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, produces toxins that block the T-cell IL-2 receptor signaling pathway, thus inhibiting maturation of Th cells, and induces a Th17 response that impairs inflammatory responses.16 One of the most common bacterial infections is Staphylococcus aureus and it is described in Box 10.2. Box 10.2 Example of Bacterial Pathogenesis: Staphylococcus aureus Infection with S. aureus is an example of how mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis come together. S. aureus is a commensal microorganism that resides on the skin and nasal passages (30% of individuals are nasal carriers), but also is an opportunistic pathogen. Minor skin infections may result if the integrity of the skin is compromised by cuts or abrasions or if hair follicles are infected. Most infections are relatively mild and localized as red and swollen eruptions on the skin containing pus or other drainage (see Figure). If not treated appropriately, more severe abscesses (pus-filled nodules in skin tissue), boils (pus-filled nodular infection of hair follicle), carbuncles (cluster of boils), or cellulitis (red and diffuse infection of inner layers of skin, dermis, and subcutaneous fat) may develop. Invasive disease results from more extensive skin damage (e.g., eczema, trauma, surgical wounds, or injection sites for intravenous drug abuse). Extensive biofilms can develop on inert materials (e.g., intravenous catheters, indwelling medical devices, or prosthetic joints). S. aureus can spread to the circulation (bacteremia, septicemia) and infect the heart valves (endocarditis), bones (osteomyelitis), and joints (infectious arthritis), and form abscesses in internal organs. Chronic medical conditions requiring hospitalization (e.g., diabetes, cancer, vascular disease, pulmonary disease, or surgery) weaken the immune system and increase the risk for invasive S. aureus infection. For instance, S. aureus is a major cause of diabetic foot ulcers resulting in limb amputation or death.1 S. aureus also has become a major cause of hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections. Healthcare providers and visitors to hospitals can easily become carriers by direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with items or surfaces (e.g., clothing, towels, or bandages) contaminated by another individual's infection. Untreated S. aureus bacteremia has an 80% fatality rate. Because of the prevalence of multiple antibiotic resistance (see Emerging Infections), even appropriate treatment has a 15% to 50% fatality rate depending on the individual's age and health. An unusually large number of virulence factors contribute to invasive infection by S. aureus. Invasion is initiated by adherence to extracellular matrix (e.g., laminin, fibrin, fibronectin) and endothelium. Two fibronectin-binding proteins bridge between fibronectin and cellular α5β1 integrin, triggering bacterial uptake by endocytosis in endothelium, epithelial cells, and other cells. S. aureus can proliferate within cells and destroy infected cells. Adherence to fibronectin also facilitates the formation of biofilms.2 Spread to bone and joints, enhanced by attachment to collagen, occurs in osteomyelitis and septic arthritis–causing strains. Staphylococci also produce a polysaccharide capsule that mediates attachment to prosthetic devices, as well as protects against phagocytosis. S. aureus is very susceptible to antibody and complementmediated neutrophil phagocytosis, but has developed a variety of effective defenses. IgG antibody is neutralized by cell surface staphylococcal protein A (SPA) and secreted staphylococcal binder of immunoglobulin. Both bind IgG at the Fc region. This IgG orientation prevents binding to surface antigens, prevents activation of complement, and masks the bacterium with human proteins. Additional masking with self-protein is provided by bacterial coagulase that activates coagulation to produce a coat of fibrin, which also inhibits phagocytosis. S. aureus inhibits the complement cascade at several key points. The thick peptidoglycan layer and a thin capsule prevent complement from binding with the bacterial membrane. Secreted complement inhibitor proteins and enzymes (e.g., staphylokinase) inhibit or break down most protective components of the complement cascade. Neutrophil phagocytic and bactericidal functions are directly inhibited by S. aureus. The primary mechanism of bacterial killing by neutrophils involves recognition of bacterial products by Tolllike receptor-2 (TLR2) and activation of oxygen-dependent killing. S. aureus produces chemokine receptor blockers (e.g., staphopain A), chemotaxis inhibitors that prevent neutrophil binding to endothelium and extravascularization (e.g., chemotaxis inhibitory protein, superantigen-like protein), metalloprotease inhibitors to prevent migration through tissue, phagocytosis inhibitors, and lysins that kill neutrophils. Bacterial protection includes blocking of TLR2 recognition of staphylococcal lipoproteins and peptidoglycan, several enzymatic inhibitors of oxygen-dependent killing in phagosomes (e.g., catalase, superoxide dismutase, hydrogen peroxide reductase, and glutathione peroxidase), and inhibitors of lysosomal granule proteases (e.g., elastase). Bacterial production of adenosine, an antiinflammatory molecule, inhibits the neutrophil respiratory burst, degranulation, and platelet-activated coagulation. S. aureus also produces a cell-bound pigment (carotenoid) that “quenches” singlet oxygen within the phagocyte. S. aureus modifies B- and T-cell responses. A variety of superantigens interfere with normal T-cell function, including diminished proliferation of antigen-specific T-helper cells. Adenosine secretion modulates T-cell activation, decreases expression of antigen-presenting major histocompatibility molecules in macrophages and dendritic cells, and suppresses the production of IL-12 that normally drives differentiation of Th1 cells. Secretion of exotoxins contributes to the pathophysiology of S. aureus infection. Many toxins are the result of uptake of new extrachromosomal genetic information from the environment, conjugation with other bacteria, or infection of bacteria with phages (viruses that infect bacteria).3 Thus different strains of S. aureus express different toxin profiles. More than 20 type I toxins (superantigens, heat-stable enterotoxins) have been associated with S. aureus infections. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are the most common cause of food poisoning with vomiting and diarrhea. The staphylococcal toxic-shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) causes the most common form of that potentially fatal disease. Exfoliative toxins are responsible for scalded skin syndrome in newborns.4 These toxins are enzymes that digest the intercellular desmosomes that maintain the integrity of skin, causing separation of the epidermis. The skin peels off as would burned skin. A battery of membrane-damaging toxins (hemolysins) mediates destruction of cells from outside (to protect against phagocytosis or open cellular barriers for invasion) or from inside (escape from phagocytic cells). S. aureus α-hemolysin (i.e., alpha-toxin) is a type II toxin that produces large pores in cell membranes, resulting in lysis of erythrocytes, breakdown of epithelial barriers, escape from a phagosome, and lysis of the macrophage plasma membrane, causing escape into the surrounding environment. Leukocidins are lytic toxins that bind to receptors on the cell surface and lyse most phagocytes. Although not yet fully understood, these leukocidins are expressed mostly by strains that cause necrotizing skin infections. S. aureus additionally secretes a variety of enzymes that nonspecifically aid invasion and defend against the immune and inflammatory response. These include lipases, proteases (e.g., a neutral protease, collagenase), nucleases (e.g., DNase), catalases, coagulases (e.g., staphylocoagulase and von Willebrand factor that activate prothrombin and deposit small amounts of fibrin on the bacteria, preventing phagocytosis and contributing to formation of abscesses and biofilms), and staphylokinase (activates plasminogen to allow escape from fibrin clots). FIGURE Staphylococcus aureus Infections. Different strains of S. aureus (gram-positive cocci in sputum from an individual with pneumonia [center photograph]) cause a variety of infections. The particular infection may depend on the toxin produced: exfoliative toxin (scalded skin syndrome), enterotoxins A–G (food poisoning), or toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1).

Infectious Fungi Fungi are eukaryotic microorganisms with thick, rigid cell walls and the capacity to form a variety of complex structures (Fig. 10.5). Fungi may grow as a mold with branched filaments or as a meshwork mycelium structure (e.g., Aspergillus spp., causing aspergillosis), yeast with ovoid or spherical shapes (Candida albicans, which causes candidiasis), or dimorphic with a yeastlike appearance in tissue and mycelium in culture (e.g., Histoplasma capsulatum, which causes histoplasmosis, a respiratory disease). Molds are aerobic and yeasts are facultative anaerobes. The cell wall is composed of polysaccharides that differ from the peptidoglycans of bacteria and are resistant to bacterial cell wall inhibitors, such as penicillin and cephalosporin. In contrast to bacteria, the cytosol of fungi contains organelles: mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, microtubules, microvesicles, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei. Many of the antifungal drugs (e.g., amphotericin B, ketoconazole, fluconazole) used to treat deep or systemic infections are toxic to the host because the fungal cell composition is similar to that of the human cell. Common pathologic fungi are summarized in Table 10.4. FIGURE 10.5 Candida albicans Morphology and Disease. A, Fungi may be either mold or yeast forms, or dimorphic.

Many pathogenic fungi (e.g., H. capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatitidis) grow as saprophytes in the environment and are transmitted by inhalation or contamination of wounds. Other medically relevant fungi either exist as human commensals or cause relatively mild infections (superficial mycoses) of the skin, nails, hair, and mucous membranes of the mouth and vagina. These include dermatophytes (e.g., tineas) and yeasts (e.g., Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus). Human-to-human transmission is the primary means of transmission of dermatophytes, for instance, Tinea pedis (athlete's foot), T. capitis (ringworm of scalp), and T. unguium (fungal infection of nails). Systemic mycosis generally results from inhalation of spores present in a contaminated environment and initially presents as a pulmonary infection. Infection that disseminates to other organs can be life threatening. Systemic mycosis caused by opportunistic fungi is usually secondary to immunosuppression caused by genetic defects, infections such as HIV, cancer, and drugs used to prevent transplant rejection. Fungi are diagnosed by microscopic observation of specimens treated with potassium hydroxide and stained to enhance visualization of spheres and filaments. Specimens also can be cultured. Skin tests are available for species of Aspergillus. Mechanisms of Fungal Invasion and Tissue Destruction. Specific adherence to the epithelium is provided by several polysaccharides on the fungal surface. Glucan, mannan, glycoprotein, and chitin molecules adhere with host receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), mannose receptors, and cadherins. A cell wall adhesion molecule, agglutinin-like sequence 3 (ALS3), on several fungi (e.g., C. albicans) promotes adherence to epithelial cells as well as silicone, thus facilitating infection of implants and other medical devices. Pneumocystis jiroveci infection is a major concern in individuals with AIDS. As with many fungi, Pneumocystis has two life-cycle forms: a cyst form and a trophic form. The cyst form is dormant, more globular with a thick wall, and when ruptured releases multiple spores. The trophic form (trophozoite) is the infectious and proliferative form. Two surface proteins, glycoprotein A (gpA) and major surface glycoprotein (MSG), mediate attachment of the trophozoite to alveolar epithelial cells leading to the development of pneumonia. Fungal Toxins and Products. Pathogenic fungi do not commonly produce toxins as virulence factors. The only identified peptide toxin related to virulence is a cytolytic toxin (candidalysin) that is crucial for C. albicans infection of mucosa.17 A sulfur-containing mycotoxin that induces apoptosis of many cells of the inflammatory and immune system is produced by A. fumigatus. Several toxins secreted by molds in the environment cause disease without fungal infection. Mycotoxins are produced by molds that grown on nuts, beans, and grains. Ingestion of these toxins affects muscle coordination, causes tremors, and may be fatal. Other fungal toxins may cause cancer; aflatoxins produced by some Aspergillus are especially carcinogenic. By mechanisms similar to those described for bacteria, fungal infections damage tissue directly by secretion of enzymes and indirectly by initiation of an inflammatory response. Secreted enzymes, such as proteases, phospholipases, and elastases, damage cells and intercellular matrix, leading to breakdown of tissue and cellular necrosis. Destructive Immune and Inflammatory Responses to Fungal Infection. The typical immune and inflammatory reaction against fungal infections involves a cell-mediated response with infiltration of T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Fungal infections can be very difficult for these systems to eradicate, leading to progressively increasing production of proinflammatory cytokines. Hyperinflammatory responses enhance virulence of A. fumigatus by increasing adhesion and invasiveness. Thus as the host's response increases so do the destructive effects on surrounding healthy tissue. In cases of persistent infection, granulomas form and compromise the normal function of the infected tissue. Pulmonary exposure to spores or soluble antigens also may elicit an IgE response and allergic pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs). Examples include allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and allergic fungal sinusitis, both of which are type I allergic reactions (see Chapter 9). Excessive degranulation of mast cells may even cause anaphylactic shock. Fungal Evasion of Immune and Inflammatory Systems. The host defense against fungal infection includes the fungistatic properties of neutrophils and macrophages. T lymphocytes are crucial in limiting the extent of infection and producing cytokines to further activate macrophages. Resistance to the individual's protective mechanisms is a complex process that requires the expression of multiple genes at different stages and different sites of infection. Pathologic fungi are generally dimorphic (e.g., H. capsulatum, B. dermatitidis, C. immitis) and readily adapt to the host environment, responding to temperature variations, low oxygen levels, more alkaline pH, and other conditions in the host tissue by undergoing changes in morphology and switching from avirulent mold forms to virulent yeast forms. Similar conditions also trigger yeasts (e.g., C. albicans) to switch from the yeast form to its more virulent hyphal form. As with parasites, rapid progression is not a major factor in immune evasion by fungi. Fungal Protection Against Phagocytosis and Intracellular Destruction. Encapsulated yeast cells (e.g., Cryptococcus neoformans) are more resistant to phagocytosis than unencapsulated yeast. A capsule is antiphagocytic by masking surface PAMPs (pathogen associated molecular patterns) and inhibiting recognition by PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) on phagocytes and epithelial cells (see Chapter 7). Aspergillus fumigatus and many other fungi produce toxic metabolites (e.g., gliotoxin) that inhibit macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis. Molecules like gliotoxin may suppress inflammation, including suppression of mast cell activation, degranulation, and secretion of leukotrienes and cytokines. Even if successfully ingested by phagocytic cells, fungi have developed complex processes for intracellular survival. Pathologic fungi are generally dimorphic (e.g., H. capsulatum, B. dermatitidis, C. immitis) and readily adapt to the host environment, responding to temperature variations, low oxygen levels, more alkaline pH, and other conditions in the host tissue by undergoing changes in morphology and switching from avirulent mold forms to virulent yeast forms. The yeast form of Histoplasma replicates in phagosomes and phagolysosomes. Some yeasts also produce proteins that inhibit the activity of lysosomal proteases. The macrophage may be destroyed as a result of membrane modification by the fungus or, in the case of Histoplasma, may harbor the fungus in granulomas. Breakdown of the granulomas over time results in release of viable fungi and recurrence of the infection. Blocking Recognition of Fungal Antigens. Altered antigen expression affords protection against the developing immune responses, although this defense strategy is used only by selected fungal pathogens. Pneumocystis contains approximately 80 different gpA and MSG genes, only 1 of which is expressed at a time. Modulation of these antigens provides resistance against immune destruction. Blocking the Immune Response. Several yeasts stimulate the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, resulting in down-regulation of the individual's immune response. The yeast C. neoformans suppresses inflammation by inhibiting production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-12 and inducing production of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL10. The overall result is suppression of macrophage function and protection against killing. Candida albicans is a common cause of infection reviewed in Box 10.3. Box 10.3 Example of Fungal Pathogenesis: Candida albicans C. albicans is the most common cause of fungal infections in humans. It is an opportunistic microorganism that is a commensal in the normal microbiome of many healthy individuals, residing in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, mouth (in 30% to 55% of healthy individuals), and vagina (in 20% of healthy women), and is normally under the control of local defense mechanisms, including members of the bacterial microbiome that produce antifungal agents. In healthy individuals, infection remains localized to the dermis (e.g., diaper rash, thrush, mild vaginal yeast infection). In those whose normal microbiome has been disturbed by antibiotic therapy (e.g., resulting in diminished levels of Lactobacillus in the vaginal microbiome) Candida overgrowth may occur, resulting in more severe vaginitis or oropharyngeal infection. In immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with diminished levels of neutrophils (neutropenia), disseminated infection may occur. Candida is the most common fungal infection in people with cancer (particularly acute leukemia and other hematologic cancers), transplantation (bone marrow and solid organ), and HIV/AIDS. Invasive candidiasis may result from biofilms on materials that provide direct entrance into the blood (e.g., indwelling catheters, intravenous lines, peritoneal dialysis) and medical implants or other devices (e.g., pacemakers, prosthetic joints, dentures). More than 5 million central venous catheters are placed yearly. Most recipients are immunosuppressed secondary to their illness or therapy, and more than 50% develop biofilms resulting in about 100,000 deaths.1 The strength of the biofilm results partially from strong intercellular adherence mediated by hyphal cells. Like most pathogenic yeasts, Candida is dimorphic and undergoes morphologic changes from unicellular yeast to filamentous hyphal forms under conditions found in the environment (e.g., alkaline pH, elevated temperature, and changes in serum factors) or inside phagolysosomes (e.g., low pH, hydrolytic enzymes, antimicrobial peptides, and the presence of reactive oxygen species). Candida expresses diverse surface adhesion molecules that permit adherence to materials in implants, epithelium, extracellular matrix, and formation of the biofilm and tissue invasion. Candida can colonize a variety of sites in the individual, apparently the result of adhesins that have broad specificity.2 The biofilm also contains a very complex extracellular matrix with fungal enzymes and other components that provide extensive resistance to the immune response, antibiotics, and environmental changes that could damage the fungus. Individuals must be treated with very high doses of antifungal antibiotics with potential toxicity to the kidneys and liver. Antibiotic resistance increases, however, as Candida up-regulates expression of efflux pumps that are the primary means of antibiotic resistance (see the section on Antimicrobials). Adaptation to the environment also results in altered profiles of surface antigens and surface carbohydrates that are identified as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and a resultant increased resistance to destruction by innate and acquired immunity. Immune suppression may occur secondary to induction of the cytokine granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that suppresses monocyte/macrophage function, including antigen presentation and production of components of the complement cascade. Decreased production of C3 results in less opsonization (C3b) and production of chemotactic activity (C3a) for phagocytes. Disseminated candidiasis may involve several internal organs, including abscesses in the kidney, brain, liver, and heart, and is characterized by persistent or recurrent fever, gram-negative shocklike symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and death. The mortality rates of sepsis or disseminated candidiasis are in the range of 30% to 40%. Candida secretes several enzymes that function as virulence factors and contribute to spread and tissue destruction. References 1. Nobile CJ, Johnson AD. Candida albicans biofilms and human disease.

Infectious Parasites and Protozoans Parasitic organisms establish symbiosis with another species in which the parasite benefits at the expense of the other species. Parasites range from unicellular protozoa to large worms. Parasitic worms (helminths) include intestinal and tissue nematodes (roundworms such as hookworms, pinworms, and ascariasis) and flatworms such as flukes (e.g., liver fluke, lung fluke, blood fluke) and tapeworms. A protozoan is a eukaryotic, unicellular microorganism with a nucleus and cytoplasm. Pathogenic protozoa primarily include sporozoa (e.g., Plasmodium, which causes malaria, and Cryptosporidium, which causes diarrhea), amoebae (e.g., Entamoeba histolytica, which causes amoebic dysentery), and flagellates (e.g., Giardia lamblia, which causes diarrhea, Trypanosoma, which causes sleeping sickness, and Leishmania, which causes skin ulcers and a visceral form that infects the spleen and liver). The most common parasitic infections in the United States include Toxoplasma gondii (a lifelong infection that may cause of blindness and miscarriage) and Trichomonas vaginalis (a common STI). Parasites are common causes of infections worldwide, with a significant effect on mortality and morbidity in developing countries. Important parasites of humans are listed in Table 10.5. TABLE 10.5 PARASITES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN HUMANS CATEGORY SUBGROUP SPECIES DISEASE ORGANS AFFECTED/SYMPTOMS Protozoa Amoeboid Entamoeba histolytica Amebiasis Dysentery, liver abscess Flagellate Giardia lamblia Giardiasis* Diarrhea Leishmania donovani, L. tropica Leishmaniasis Sores on skin, progression to liver, spleen Trichomonas vaginalis Trichomoniasis Inflammation of reproductive organs Trypanosoma cruzi, T. brucei Chagas disease: African sleeping sickness Generalized, blood, lymph nodes, progressing to cardiac and central nervous system (CNS) Ciliate Balantidium coli Balantidiasis Small intestines, invasion of colon, diarrhea Sporozoa (nonmotile) Cryptosporidium parvum, C. hominis Cryptosporidiosis* Intestine, diarrhea Plasmodium spp. Malaria Blood, liver Toxoplasma gondii Toxoplasmosis* Intestine, eyes, blood, heart, liver Fasciola hepatica Fasciolosis Liver destruction Paragonimus westermani Lung fluke disease Granuloma in lung, spinal cord Schistosoma mansoni Schistosomiasis Blood, diarrhea, bladder, generalized symptoms Tapeworms (cestodes) Taenia solium Pork tapeworm Encysts in muscle, brain, liver Roundworms (nematodes) Ascaris lumbricoides Ascariasis Intestinal obstruction, bile duct obstruction Necator americanus (hookworm) Hookworm disease Intestinal parasite Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) Trichuriasis Diarrhea Helminths Flukes (trematodes) Trichinella spiralis Trichinosis* Wuchereria bancrofti Filariasis, elephantiasis Lymphatics Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) Pinworm infection Intestines Strongyloides stercoralis (threadworm) Strongyloidiasis Onchocerca volvulus Onchocerciasis *Most Intestine, diarrhea, muscle, CNS, death Intestinal parasite, skin infection Blindness, dermatitis common in the United States. Mechanisms of Parasite Invasion and Tissue Destruction Parasite Invasion. Parasite invasion of tissue can be broadly characterized as by extracellular or intracellular mechanisms. There is considerable variation within both mechanisms because of complex life cycles, means of transmission, and unique adaptations among parasites. A common component of invasion is adherence to and breakdown of connective tissue and basement membranes. Helminths may infect the gastrointestinal tract or enter through the skin. An example is Schistosoma mansoni, a blood fluke infection where the aquatic larval form attaches to and penetrates the skin using a family of proteases that degrade elastin and other skin components. After entering the circulatory system, the parasite may burrow into other organs. Extracellular parasites enter through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia), the vagina as STIs (Trichomonas vaginalis), or through the skin in bites (Trypanosoma brucei). After attachment to the lining of the gastrointestinal tract or vagina, extracellular parasites undergo evolution to more invasive forms. Most intracellular protozoan parasites can only reproduce within host cells and are therefore obligatory intracellular parasites. These include Leishmania spp. (leishmaniasis causing ulcers of skin and internal organs), Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis with possible latent infection of the brain and eye), Cryptosporidium parvum (cryptosporidiosis causing watery diarrhea), and Plasmodium spp. (malaria). Infections are obtained by ingestion of contaminated food or water or through bites from insect vectors. Invasion is mediated by adhesion to lectins on cells near the site of infection and invasion of the tissue using a host of proteases and other enzymes. Very soon these protozoa invade cells (i.e., fibroblasts, mesenchymal cells) or undergo phagocytosis (i.e., macrophages) where reproduction occurs resulting in progressive cell lysis and spread to neighboring cells. Toxins and Parasite Products. Toxins are not as prevalent in the pathogenesis of parasitic diseases as in bacterial diseases. C. parvum produces hemolysin H4, which is very similar to E. coli O157:H7 and disrupts cell membranes. E. histolytica produces a small-molecular weight pore-forming toxin (amoebapore) that inserts pores into the membrane of intestinal cells resulting in increased calcium influx, efflux of water, and diarrhea. Endotoxin is normally associated with gram-negative bacteria, but similar molecules are produced by African trypanosomes and Plasmodium falciparum (most severe form of malaria). Most of the tissue damage caused by parasites is secondary to the release of enzymes such as proteases and phospholipases. These enzymes help invasion by destroying surrounding extracellular matrix and tissue. Destructive Immune and Inflammatory Responses to Parasite Infection. Because of their size, tissue damage caused by large multicellular parasites is generally a direct result of parasitic accumulation in the tissue or secondary to the individual's immune and inflammatory responses. Large infestations may lead to physical loss of function in a tissue or organ. For instance, a large number of intestinal parasites (e.g., the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides, tapeworms, and Giardia spp.) compete for and prevent uptake of nutrients, leading to various forms of malabsorption, blocked uptake of fats, or anemia from malabsorption of B12, or from large amounts of blood loss. Some roundworms (e.g., Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi) block the lymphatics and cause accumulation of large amounts of lymph in tissues (i.e., elephantiasis). The larvae of tapeworms (e.g., Taenia solium) encyst in and prevent normal function of organs (e.g., muscle, liver, eye), which is particularly dangerous in the human brain. Parasitic infections may also damage tissue through exacerbated inflammation or initiation of immune hypersensitivity reactions. C. parvum induces considerable release of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cells, inducing influx of inflammatory cells and increased tissue destruction. Ascaris larvae migrate to bronchi causing pulmonary inflammation. IgE-mediated anaphylactic responses have been observed associated with infections with helminths and African trypanosomes. Helminth parasites (e.g., schistosomiasis) may deposit eggs in organs (e.g., the liver) leading to a chronic cell-mediated response and persistent production of proinflammatory cytokines with formation of granulomas. Rapid progression is not used as a protective mechanism for parasites. Parasite Protection Against Phagocytosis and Intracellular Destruction. Several parasites (Leishmania spp.) are obligative intracellular organisms of monocytes and macrophages. Leishmania uses components of the complement system for entrance into macrophages. Once in the macrophage, several mechanisms are used to facilitate survival of parasites. T. gondii produces toxins that prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion so that the environment in the phagosome remains relatively nontoxic. E. histolytica (amoebiasis) releases phospholipase and pore-forming proteins that disrupt the phagocyte's plasma membrane. T. cruzi (Chagas disease, sleeping sickness) escapes from the phagosome and grows in the macrophage cytoplasm. Leishmania reproduces within phagocytic cells and inhibits respiratory burst and chemotaxis. Blocking Recognition of Parasitic Antigens. Pathogens that coat themselves with human proteins may be disguised and “fool” the immune system. For instance, schistosomes and trypanosomes mask their antigens by absorbing IgG by the Fc portion of the molecule. Much more commonly, those pathogens that undergo part of their life cycle in humans, or may assume multiple morphologic forms during infection, also will undergo antigenic changes related to the stage in the life cycle or morphology. Some protozoa have developed very complex alterations in surface antigens using gene switching. For example, African trypanosomes, carried by tsetse flies, can vary the structure of their antigenic coat (variant surface glycoproteins) using gene switching thus allowing them to be protected from immune defenses. Newly produced antibodies will not recognize the variant antigen coat allowing the trypanosome to survive. Parasite Blocking of the Immune Response. Parasites use an array of mechanisms to block protective immune responses including: (1) secretion of enzymes that degrade immunoglobulins (schistosomes); (2) inactivation of complement (e.g. Echinococcus spp., Leishmania spp. and trypansomes); (3) prevention of antigen processing by macrophages (Leishmania); (4) inhibition of complement mediated phagocyte chemotaxis (E. hisolytica); and (5) inhibition of T-cell function (schistosomes). These responses may be pathogen specific or non-specific. Malaria, a plasmodium parasite, has been very successful at mounting immune defenses and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Details related to malaria are presented in Box 10.4. Box 10.4 Parasitic Pathogenesis: Plasmodium and Malaria Malaria is one of the most common debilitating infections worldwide. The WHO estimated that in 2015 there were 214 million new cases of malaria worldwide and more than 400,000 malariarelated deaths, more than 90% occurring in Africa, and most of whom were children.1 Malaria is caused by five species of Plasmodium parasites that infect humans (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, P. knowlesi [a simian parasite that causes human malaria primarily in Malaysia]), although two species account for the most cases and deaths.2 Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent in Africa and accounts for most fatalities. Infection results in severe chills, high fever, sweating, headache, muscle pains, vomiting, severe anemia, and pulmonary edema. Neurologic complications may result from infected red blood cells (RBCs) adhering to endothelium in capillaries of the brain causing hypoxia and degradation of neural tissue.3 The most severely affected individuals may develop cardiovascular collapse, shock, coma, and death. P. vivax is the primary cause of malaria outside of Africa. Symptoms are severe flulike in nature and with less morbidity and mortality than observed with P. falciparum. All forms of malaria are characterized by paroxysm (cyclic chills followed by fever). Cycles range from every 2 days for P. vivax to 36 hours for P. falciparum. The life cycle of Plasmodium requires two hosts: mosquito and human. The parasite undergoes a sexual reproductive cycle in the salivary gland of the female Anopheles mosquito and is transmitted to humans during a blood meal. The infectious form (sporozoite) enters the tissue and migrates to the bloodstream. The sporozoite has the capacity to traverse through cells in the tissue, mediated by a variety of parasitic proteins that bind to specific substance on the cell surface and facilitate entry.4 The parasite enters hepatocytes using sporozoite proteins that bind to sulfated molecules on endothelial cells and Kupffer cells. Protection against malaria may occur by means of stage-specific immune responses against different phases of the life cycle: invasive stage, hepatic stage, pre-erythrocyte stage, erythrocyte stage, and sexual stages. Phagocytic cells, like Kupffer cells, are the primary means of protection against the prehepatic invasive stage and hepatic stage. Traversal of phagocytic cells results in modulation of the cell's cytokine profile, causing downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) and upregulation of antiinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10), blocked production of reactive oxygen species, and reduced expression of class I MHC to suppress antigen presentation.5 The parasite in the blood avoids destruction by phagocytes in the spleen by expressing adhesion proteins that cause adherence and sequestration along the walls of the small vessels. Sequestration in the liver begins an asymptomatic stage during which several rounds of multiplication occur. P. vivax and P. ovale can remain dormant in the liver for years, protected from the immune system by intracellular residence. In the hepatocytes, the parasites transform to the merozoite form, thousands of which are released into the blood during hepatocyte rupture and infect erythrocytes. The blood-borne phase and infection of erythrocytes begin the symptomatic stage of the disease (see Figure). P. falciparum uses a variety of parasite surface proteins (e.g., merozoite surface protein-1 [MSP-1]) for adhesion to erythrocyte membrane glycophorins and entrance into the cell.6 P. vivax seems to use the erythrocyte Duffy antigen for adhesion. Thus individuals who are negative for the Duffy blood group antigen are naturally resistant to P. vivax malaria. Symptoms of malaria occur after an approximate 2-week period from the initial mosquito bite and are the result of asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes and cell lysis upon the release of daughter parasites that reinfect other erythrocytes. During this erythrocytic cycle, the merozoites mature into male and female gametocytes within the erythrocyte, which after another blood meal can establish another cycle of further sexual multiplication in the mosquito vector. The erythrocytic cycle will resolve, but many relapses will occur upon new cycles of merozoite release from infected hepatocytes. During the erythrocytic cycle, the infected individual produces protective antibodies against antigens expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes. Plasmodium expresses several families of antigens on the erythrocyte's surface and uses antigen variation through gene switching diversity to mitigate the effects of antibody. Other antigen-directed responses contribute to protection of the parasite. Antibodies against P. falciparum asparagine-rich protein enhance merozoite invasion of erythrocytes, which is further facilitated by the addition of complement. The PfEMP1 antigen also can protect the infected erythrocyte by epitope masking. The antigen contains Fc binding sites where IgM antibody, regardless of specificity, is bound by its Fc region, thus masking the PfEMP1 epitopes. Parasites also can bind complement regulator factor, factor H, which protects the parasite from damage by activated complement factors. Malarial infection also may induce immune suppression by inhibiting macrophage and dendritic cell phagocytosis, as well as inducing apoptosis of antigen-presenting cells. Phagocytic cell function is diminished by a malarial pigment (hemozoin), which is taken up and reduces the ability to phagocytize merozoites or infected erythrocytes. Numbers of CD4 and CD8 T-cells are diminished by apoptosis combined with induction of immunosuppressive Treg cells. Malarial parasites have developed broad drug resistance including against chloroquine, the previous mainstay of the preventive and therapeutic arsenal of antimalarial drugs. Drug resistance appears to result from increased activity of drug transporters that eliminate the drugs from the parasitic microorganism. FIGURE Malaria Giemsa-stained smears.

Infectious Viruses Viruses are extremely simple microorganisms and do not possess any of the metabolic organelles found in prokaryotes (e.g., bacteria) or eukaryotes (e.g., human cells). The basic viral structure (virion) consists of nucleic acid protected by a protein shell, the capsid. The capsid may take many characteristic shapes: helical, icosahedral, or large pleomorphic (Fig. 10.6). Some viruses also have the capsid surrounded by a protective envelope, which consists of the plasma membrane from the previously infected cell. FIGURE 10.6 Electron Micrographs of Representative Viral Structures. A, Rotavirus: particles with a double shell and a characteristic “wheel-andspoke” appearance. B, Epstein-Barr virus: icosahedral enveloped DNA virus. C, Adenovirus: particles with characteristic icosahedral structures. D, Paramyxovirus: spherical enveloped RNA virus. RNA is seen spilling out of the disrupted virus. (A from Long S, Pickering L, Prober C: Principles and practice of pediatric infectious diseases, ed 3, Philadelphia, 2005, Saunders; B and D photos courtesy Science Source; © Photo Researchers, Inc., New York, NY; C from Mandell GL, Bennett JE, Dolin R: Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's principles and practice of infectious diseases, ed 7, Philadelphia, 2010, Churchill Livingstone.) Viruses are classified by the format of nucleic acid in the virion, which may be RNA or DNA and either single-stranded (ss) or doublestranded (ds), and by whether the virus uses the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) for replication. Thus seven classifications are used: dsDNA (e.g., herpesvirus, smallpox virus), ssDNA (parvovirus), dsRNA (rotavirus), ssRNA +sense (+sense functions as mRNA) (e.g., hepatitis A and C viruses, SARS virus, poliovirus, rhinovirus), ssRNA −sense (e.g., Ebola virus, Marburg virus, influenza virus, hantavirus, Lassa virus, and viruses that cause measles, mumps, and rabies), ssRNA +sense with RT (e.g., HIV), and dsDNA with RT (e.g., hepatitis B virus). Viral diseases are the most common afflictions of humans. Examples of human diseases caused by specific viruses are listed in Table 10.6.

Mechanisms of Invasion and Tissue Destruction Viral Invasion. Viral pathogens directly destroy or damage cells as part of their replication in infected cells. Viruses are obligatory intracellular microorganisms; thus transmission is frequently from one infected cell to an uninfected cell. The viral life cycle involves several steps: attachment to the target cell (determines host range and tropism), penetration (by endocytosis or membrane fusion), uncoating (release of viral nucleic acid from the viral capsid by viral or host enzymes), replication (synthesis of viral proteins and mRNA), assembly (formation of new virions), and release (by lysis or budding). Attachment involves specific interactions between surface proteins on the virus and receptors on the cell to be infected. The specificity of the virus for these receptors and the distribution of receptors throughout the individual's tissues dictate the range of host cells that a particular virus can infect. An example is epstein-Barr virus (EBV, which causes mononucleosis) binds to complement receptor 2 (CR2) on B lymphocytes. Once bound, the virion penetrates the plasma membrane by envelope fusion with cellular membranes or receptormediated endocytosis (Fig. 10.7). FIGURE 10.7 Stages of Viral Entrance during Infection of a Cell. The viral life cycle includes 1, attachment; 2, uncoating; 3, replication; and 4, release. Viral entrance into a cell is by one of three mechanisms. A, Some enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) express fusion proteins that (1) bind to receptors on the target cell and (2) mediate membrane fusion and release of the viral nucleocapsid directly into the cytoplasm. (3) Within the cytoplasm the virus uncoats the protective nucleocapsid and releases viral nucleic acid and (4) release by exocytosis. B, Other enveloped viruses (e.g., influenza virus) (1) bind to receptors that trigger (2) receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virion particle. (3) The endosome fuses with lysosomes. The relative acidic conditions in the endosome trigger membrane fusion, formation of fusion pores, breakdown of the capsid, and (4) release of viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm. C, Viral particles without an envelope (e.g., poliovirus) (1) express viral spikes that bind to the cell membrane and (2) initiate receptor-mediated endocytosis of the viral particle. (3) The acidic conditions in the endosome cause capsid breakdown and formation of pores in the endosomal membrane through which viral nucleic acid enters the cytoplasm and (4) release of virus. Most RNA viruses directly produce mRNA, which is translated into viral proteins, and genomic RNA, which is eventually packaged into new viruses. DNA viruses are transcribed in the nucleus into mRNA before protein translation in the cytoplasm. Some viruses can enter a period of latency during which production of a new virus ceases with concurrent resolution of disease symptoms. One particular family of viruses, retroviruses (e.g., HIV), carries the enzyme reverse transcriptase that creates a double-stranded DNA provirus that integrates into the host cell's chromosomal DNA, and may be transmitted to the daughter cells during mitosis. By this process, viral genes can become part of the genetic information of the cell and its progeny. Insertion into the DNA is random. If viral DNA is inserted at a nonessential site the cell may be unaffected, if into an essential gene the cell may undergo death, and if insertion modifies genes related to normal growth the cell may be transformed (become cancerous). Episomal latency is associated with viral genes outside the cell DNA (episome), in a linear or circular conformation, either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. Episomal latency is characteristic of herpesviruses (e.g., HSV1 and 2, EBV). Latency must be actively maintained by latencyassociated transcript (LAT) genes that inhibit apoptosis. The infected cell will remain functional, and the virus will remain dormant until activated. HSV1 (herpes simplex) is latent as a circular double- stranded DNA in the nuclei of peripheral neurons and may be reactivated to a lytic cycle in response to stress, sunlight, diet, or other events.20 Reactivation results in shedding of virions from nerves into the mucosa of the mouth or genitals. At the end of the replicate phase, new virus particles are released from the cell for transmission of the viral infection to neighboring uninfected cells. The method of release depends on the particular virus. Enveloped viruses are released through budding, in which shed viral particles are enveloped in the plasma membrane from the surface of the infected cell. Viral envelope proteins are inserted into the membrane and cluster at sites of budding. Translation of viralspecific mRNA produces capsid and matrix proteins that assemble and incorporate viral nucleic acid. Budding is not immediately destructive to the cell, whereas nonenveloped viruses are commonly released in large numbers concurrent with the destruction of the cell. Some viruses induce a progressive apoptosis during which virions are packaged in apoptotic vesicles. The vesicles are portions of the plasma membrane released from the dying cell. Vesicles will break down and release virions into the surrounding environment. Apoptotic vesicles also may undergo phagocytosis by macrophages and establish infections (e.g., HIV) in the macrophage. Other viruses are released by exocytosis, during which the cell may not be destroyed. New viral particles in the cytoplasm are packaged in vesicles, transported to the cell surface, and released. This process is generally used by nonenvelope viruses. Toxins and Viral Products. Generally, viruses rarely produce toxins or other destructive products that cause tissue damage. The products of viral genes are directed toward adherence to target cells, providing components of the reproductive cycle, and evasion of immune and inflammatory responses. Some products that are important to the viral life cycle may therefore indirectly lead to cellular destruction. An exception to the rarity of viral toxins is the rotavirus nonstructural protein (NSP4). NSP4 is an enterotoxin that affects intracellular calcium levels in intestinal cells resulting in water efflux and diarrhea, particularly in infants and children. Destructive Immune and Inflammatory Responses to Viral Infection. Most of the symptoms of viral infection (e.g., fever, aches, nausea) are generally mild, caused by the individual's own inflammatory response to infection, and usually resolve in a relatively short time. More severe local cellular effects may result from destruction of infected cells by lymphocytes. The dermal and ocular lesions of HSV infection result from T-cell mediated cytotoxicity of infected epithelial cells. A Th2 cell response is primarily responsible for severe respiratory syncytial virus related lesions in the lower respiratory tract (see Chapter 8). Many viruses induce excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and many more), mediators (e.g., prostaglandins, histamines), and reactive oxygen species, all of which contribute to tissue damage. Hepatitis viruses provoke immune and inflammatory responses that may damage infected and noninfected hepatic cells. Hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis B (HBV) viruses may cause acute liver damage, whereas hepatitis C (HCV) virus infection is usually subclinical with no apparent liver damage. The degree of T cell infiltration of the liver is related to the degree of liver pathology. CD8-positive T-cytotoxic cells attack and destroy virus-infected liver cells (see Chapter 8). HBV and HCV activate Th17 cells that contribute to inflammation of the liver. Individuals with high amounts of circulating viral antigen (e.g., hepatitis B) are at risk for developing symptoms of type III hypersensitivity reactions including kidney disease and vascular inflammation (see Chapter 9). Viral Evasion of Immune and Inflammatory Systems Rapid Progression of Viruses. Some viruses, particularly those with small genomes, rapidly proliferate after the initial infection and produce a large number of virions more quickly than the immune system can develop. By the development of an effective adaptive immune response in 4 or 5 days, the virus has spread and caused severe clinical disease. Viral Protection Against Phagocytosis and Intracellular Destruction. Viruses are the prime examples of intercellular survival. As obligatory intracellular pathogens, viruses hide and proliferate within cells and away from normal inflammatory or immune responses. Viral particles that spread through the blood to infect other cells encounter antibodies, which in most cases cure the infection. Thus most viral infections are self-limiting. Interferons are particularly effective against many viral infections, and viral survival mechanisms have evolved to mitigate these effects. A great many viruses have developed methods of blocking every step of type I interferon cascade, thus preventing production of IFN1 by infected cells and induction of antiviral substances in neighboring cells. Viruses encounter intracellular PRRs designed to bind viral substances and initiate protective innate responses (discussed in Chapter 7). Successful viral pathogens have developed mechanisms to either block TLR recognition of viral substances or prevent TLR signaling. Blocking Recognition of Viral Antigens. Enveloped viruses are excellent examples of how this mechanism may succeed. The viral capsid is completely surrounded by a cellular plasma membrane that is highly similar to that of an uninfected cell. Only a few critical differences exist. In order to infect another cell, the virion expresses membrane-associated viral envelope proteins that are critical for the intercellular fusion process. These proteins are virusspecific and targets for protective immune responses. Other viruses, such as the HCV, coat themselves with normal proteins from the infected host, such as lipoproteins, that mask the viral epitopes from circulating antibody. Some viruses (e.g., HIV) increase antigenic diversity by incorporating frequent functional translational errors. Viral enzymes can create small errors in reading mRNA leading to minor changes in the viral proteins. These changes are not at functionally critical sites but may provide resistance to specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms. In a manner similar to bacteria, other viruses have multiple stable antigenic serotypes. A person who recovers from an infection with one serotype may not have protective immunity against other serotypes of the same virus. At least 100 different serotypes of rhinovirus can cause the “common cold,” which explains why individuals can catch many colds throughout their lives. Blocking the Immune Response to Viral Infection. HIV and other viruses have developed the capacity to infect and kill immune cells, thus protecting themselves but also leading to a broad immunosuppression against other antigens. This process is discussed more thoroughly in the section on AIDS. Some viruses have developed mechanisms for interfering with antigen processing and presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Endogenous antigens, such as viral antigens, are normally degraded by proteasomes, transported into the endoplasmic reticulum, and complexed with MHC class I molecules for expression on the cell surface and presentation to appropriate cells of the immune response (see Chapter 8). Many of the herpesviruses and retroviruses prevent steps in this process. For instance, EBV inhibits degradation by the proteasomes. HSV can prevent binding of the antigenic peptide to MHC class I. Inhibition of antigen presentation by MHC class I prevents the generation of effective T-cell immune responses. CMV has developed a unique modification of affecting MHC processing. Natural killer (NK) cells are the principal defenders against tumor cells or virally infected cells that are not recognized by T-cytotoxic cells because of downregulated MHC expression. NK cell function is suppressed, however, if the infected cell expresses class I MHC molecules. CMV is capable of preventing antigen presentation by MHC class I and stimulates the expression of a MHC-like molecule that cannot present antigen but suppresses NK cells. Thus CMVinfected cells are protected from both T-cytotoxic cells and NK cell killing. Some viruses also have the capacity to produce molecules that mimic cytokines or their ligands and neutralize the effects of cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF-α. Cells infected with vaccinia virus (the less virulent vaccine relative of smallpox virus) produce a protein that can bind to IL-1. These molecules are frequently called cytokine decoys. Viruses are sensitive to complement activation. Protection can be provided by incorporation of complement inhibitors into the envelope (e.g., HIV and vaccinia). CMV induces complement inhibitors on the surface of infected cells. HSV expresses a cell surface protein (glycoprotein C-1) that binds and inhibits C3b, as well as blocks formation of the membrane attack complex. Influenza viruses causes significant seasonal epidemics throughout the world. Box 10.5 reviews the pathogenesis of influenza. Box 10.5 The Pathogenesis of Influenza Influenza is an ssRNA (−strand) virus with a segmented genome. It is transmitted through aerosols or body fluids and is highly infectious. The virions attach to and enter respiratory epithelial cells. Symptoms begin 1 to 4 days after infection and may include chills, fever, sore throat, muscle aches, severe headaches, coughing, weakness, and generalized discomfort. Nausea and vomiting may occur in children. Infection may lead to viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, both of which can be fatal, particularly in young children and older adults. The normal rate of infectivity is about 5% to 15%, with a mortality rate of about 0.1%, and in most cases recovery occurs in 1 to 2 weeks. The influenza virion is enveloped and expresses two surface proteins that are essential to virulence: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA is a glycoprotein that binds to the carbohydrate sialic acid which is richly expressed on the surface of respiratory epithelium. The HA molecule is cut by a human protease, thus signaling a process of endocytosis that internalizes the virus into an endosomal vacuole.1 The endosomal vacuole is acidic (about pH 5), which initiates HA-dependent fusion between the viral envelope and endosomal membrane.2 The viral core disassembles and releases viral RNA (vRNA) and core proteins into the cytoplasm. The virion carries an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that transcribes the vRNA into +strand ssRNA copies that are used to produce more vRNA. Viral proteins are translated and new HA and NA molecules are inserted into the plasma membrane and cluster. Copies of vRNA and capsid proteins are assembled underneath the HA and NA clusters and begin the budding process. HAs on the budding virus remain attached to surface glycans; new virions must be released by the action of the neuraminidase (NA) that cuts the sialic acid. Thus HA is essential for entrance and NA is essential for release of new virions. The infected cell usually dies during this process. Antibodies against the HA and NA antigens are responsible for protection against influenza infection. Infections are seasonal and protection gained from the previous year's infection is partial and does not totally protect against influenza in the following year because the HA and NA antigens undergo yearly change. Usually antigenic variation is relatively minor (antigenic drift) and results from mutations. Yearly revaccination is necessary to produce immunity against changes resulting from antigenic drift. Two major groups of influenza virus, influenza A and influenza B, infect humans and both undergo drift. Influenza A and influenza B contain 8 RNA segments that encode at least 10 proteins. Influenza A infects birds and some mammals. Influenza B infects mostly humans and seals and undergoes antigenic drift much more slowly than influenza A. Several major variants of HA (18 forms, numbered 1–18) and NA (11 forms, numbered 1–11) have been identified for influenza A. One particular viral strain will express a single HA and a single NA. The particular HA and NA variant being expressed becomes part of the nomenclature of the particular yearly viral strains (e.g. strain H3N2), important for the development of yearly vaccines. Influenza A periodically undergoes major antigenic changes (antigenic shifts) (see Figure). Shifts occur in animals coinfected by a human and an avian strain of influenza. Because the genome is segmented, the segments can undergo recombination during which the human virus obtains a new HA or NA antigen. When such changes occur, previous protective antibodies may not be effective, resulting in a major pandemic and more severe disease. As with most vaccines, not everyone is protected. Research is in progress to induce protective antibody responses against common surface antigens shared by genetically diverse influenza viruses thus providing a long lasting protection. Pharmacologic therapy may lessen the severity of symptoms. Competitive neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), bind to NA and inhibit enzymatic activity, thus preventing spread of the virions between cells. If the NA mutates, the drugs may lose inhibitory capacity, which may explain observations of the rapid development of drug resistance. Several variables affect the pathophysiology of influenza infections. Less aggressive strains primarily infect epithelium lining the upper respiratory tract. The proliferation of virus within infected cells results in tissue damage far in excess to what is seen with cold viruses. More aggressive strains can infect cells that are deeper in the lungs and produce even more tissue damage. The differences are related somewhat to the particular HA antigen expressed on the virus. The HA normally binds to α2-6 sialylated glycans in the upper respiratory tract. The highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus binds to upper respiratory tract cells and also to α23 sialylated glycans on pneumocytes (cells lining the alveoli of the lungs) leading to severe pneumonia. Influenza has several virulence factors that contribute to the pathophysiology. All influenza strains can inhibit the innate antiviral interferon response. The influenza ssRNA is recognized by intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7) which induce the production of antiviral type I interferons (IFNs). The primary difference between strains of low or high pathogenicity is the intensity of cytokine and chemokine production. Tissue damage typically attracts macrophages that induce apoptosis of epithelial cells, thus increasing the amount of damage. The more pathogenic viruses induce more tissue damage and a level of cytokine and chemokine production that is referred to as a cytokine storm. Pulmonary damage is greatly exacerbated, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, and fibrin deposition, all of which may lead to respiratory failure. Systemic cytokine levels are greatly elevated, resulting in multiorgan dysfunction. The unexpectedly large number of deaths in the 20 to 39 age group during the 1918 influenza pandemic appeared to be related to an excessive number of neutrophils attracted to the lungs and to an intense cytokine storm reflecting their healthy and highly responsive immune systems. FIGURE Antigenic Shifts in Influenza Virus. One theory proposes that antigenic shifts occur when a human influenza virus (blue) and an avian influenza virus (red) coinfect a species that is permissive for both. The eight ssRNA strands are coexpressed in the same infected cell, resulting in mixing of the strands so that a hybrid virus can be produced. The hybrid virus indicated here contains all the genetic information of the original virus that infected humans, but contains a new hemagglutinin (HA)-containing strand from the avian virus. This virus expresses a new HA antigen and will be less susceptible to residual immunity that normally provides partial protection against yearly influenza infections.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome The most notable form of secondary or acquired immune deficiency is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV is a retrovirus that infects and depletes a portion of the immune system (CD4+ Th cells), making individuals extremely susceptible to life-threatening infections and malignancies (Fig. 10.8). FIGURE 10.8 Clinical Symptoms of AIDS.

When AIDS was recognized as a major health epidemic in subSaharan Africa and in the United States in the early 1980s, an AIDS diagnosis was considered a death sentence, with a near 100% mortality rate within 2 years of the diagnosis of AIDS. With the advent of aggressive treatment with antiretroviral drugs in the mid1990s and widespread public health campaigns, HIV/AIDS has become a chronic and manageable illness with many infected individuals having a near normal life span. Currently, about half of the 18 million individuals living with HIV/AIDS in Africa are being administered antiretroviral drugs.21 As yet, however, antiviral medications are not fully available at an affordable price in many parts of the world where HIV/AIDS remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality. The transmission of HIV in Africa is predominantly heterosexual, whereas the distribution of individuals with HIV/AIDS in the United States reflects the primary means of transmission within the original cohort. Although isolated cases of what was later identified as AIDS occurred in the United States as early as 1959, the appearance of the AIDS epidemic has been linked to several gay males who had contracted HIV infection during visits to the Caribbean, probably Haiti.22 Initial reports of outbreaks in the United States were of gay men who developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia23 and aggressive Kaposi sarcoma,24 both of which were uncommon and mostly observed in immune-deficient individuals. The epidemic then spread to intravenous drug abusers and heterosexuals. In 2014 (the latest available statistics) 44,073 men and women were newly diagnosed with HIV infection with gay or bisexual men representing 67% of all individuals and 83% newly diagnosed men.25 Women represented 19% of newly diagnosed individuals with 87% of women contracting HIV through heterosexual encounters. As a result of aggressive antiretroviral therapy and public education, the transmission to women had declined by about 40% over the previous decade. About 6% of all individuals newly diagnosed with HIV were associated with intravenous drug abuse. In 2015, 18,303 people were diagnosed with AIDS, and since the early 1980s, 1,216,917 people have been diagnosed with AIDS. In 2014, 6721 deaths were attributed directly to HIV infection. An estimated 650,000 individuals with a diagnosis of AIDS have died since the early 1980s. Transmission of HIV HIV is a blood-borne pathogen present in body fluids with the typical routes of transmission: blood or blood products, intravenous drug abuse, heterosexual and homosexual activity, and maternal-child transmission before or during birth. The CDC estimates that 91% of new HIV infections in the United States result from sexual activity with those who are undiagnosed or diagnosed but not treated for HIV infection. As with all blood-borne infections, healthcare providers are at increased risk of contracting the infection from an individual's blood. Since the strict implementation of universal precautions and the use of post-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs, infection of healthcare providers is extremely rare. Pathogenesis of HIV HIV-1 was initially isolated by researchers at the Pasteur Institute as the lymphadenopathy/AIDS virus (LAV), a discovery for which they received the 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine.26 A second major and less virulent variant, HIV-2, was identified later and is found mostly in western Africa. HIV is a member of the retrovirus family, which carries genetic information in the form of two identical copies of single-stranded RNA (Fig. 10.9 see the genetic map of HIV-1, Fig. E 10.1 on Evolve). The RNA copies are packaged in the viral particle within a capsid constructed of viral capsid protein p24. The capsid also contains two viral enzymes: reverse transcriptase and integrase. Retroviral particles are contained in a plasma membrane envelope originating during release from the infected cell. The membrane contains two viral proteins (gp41 and gp120), referred to as envelope proteins. Between the envelope and capsid are viral matrix proteins underlying the envelope and another viral enzyme, a protease. FIGURE 10.9 HIV-1: Structure. The HIV-1 virion consists of a core of two identical strands of viral RNA molecules, three viral enzymes (integrase [IN], protease [PR], and reverse transcriptase [RT]) and a capsid. The capsid is further encased in a matrix consisting primarily of a viral protein. The outer surface is an envelope consisting of the plasma membrane of the cell from which the virus budded (lipid bilayer) and two viral glycoproteins: a transmembrane gp41 and a noncovalently attached surface protein, gp120. (Modified from Kumar V et al: Robbins & Cotran pathologic basis of disease, ed 9, Philadelphia, 2015, Saunders.) As with all other viruses, the life cycle must begin with attachment and entrance into its cellular target. HIV is primarily tropic for CD4+ T-helper cells, although macrophages and dendritic cells also express CD4 and can be infected. Attachment occurs between the viral envelope proteins and CD4 (Fig. 10.10). The envelope protein gp41 is anchored in the plasma membrane and is referred to as the TM (transmembrane) protein. The N-terminal portion of TM consists of very hydrophobic amino acids. The TM associates with a gp120 envelope protein, called the SU (surface protein), which contains binding sites for CD4. When the SU protein attaches to CD4, it undergoes a conformational change that allows further recognition of cell surface chemokine receptors, primarily CCR5, and exposure of the TM hydrophobic tail, which interacts with the lipid region of the T cell and initiates a process of fusion between the viral envelope and the cellular membrane. The fusion event releases the viral capsid into the cellular cytoplasm, where it undergoes uncoating (shedding of capsid proteins) and release of viral RNA and enzymes. FIGURE 10.10 Life Cycle and Possible Sites of Therapeutic Intervention of HIV-1. The HIV-1 life cycle is susceptible to blockage at several sites. Some agents could block the attachment and entrance of the virus (entrance inhibitors). Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., azidothymidine [AZT]) prevent the reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA. Drugs also may be able to inhibit the viral integrase (integrase inhibitors) and prevent insertion of the provirus into the host's chromosomes. Protease inhibitors specifically inhibit the viral protease and prevent the processing of the gp160 into viral capsid and matrix proteins. (Modified from Kumar V et al: Robbins & Cotran pathologic basis of disease, ed 9, Philadelphia, 2015, Saunders.) The third step in the life cycle, integration, is controlled by reverse transcriptase, which converts single-stranded viral RNA into doublestranded DNA. The viral integrase inserts viral DNA into the infected cell's DNA, where it may remain dormant. If replication is activated, the gag gene encodes a large precursor protein that undergoes posttranslational modification by the viral protease to generate smaller matrix (e.g., p17) and capsid proteins (e.g., p24). The env gene encodes a large gp160 glycoprotein that is processed by a cellular protease (furin) into the TM and SU proteins. The capsid and nuclear components of the virus undergo assembly in the cytoplasm, and the Env proteins are inserted into the plasma membrane. The assembled particle buds from the cell surface as an infectious virion. The major immunologic finding in AIDS is the striking decrease in the number of CD4+ Th cells. Several mechanisms of Th cell killing are used.27 The replication and release of new virions triggers apoptotic cell death of the infected cell. The release of death ligands (e.g., Fas ligand [FasL], TNF) initiates apoptosis in neighboring uninfected Th cells. The infected Th cell also becomes a target for killing by CD8+ Tcytotoxic cells. Clinical Manifestations of HIV With the advent of antiretroviral drugs, the early identification of HIV infection is essential. The CDC has issued a new system for staging HIV infection at diagnosis and during monitoring of therapeutic effectiveness and managing the disease.28 The stages are adapted for every age group and based primarily on diagnostic laboratory tests. Stage 0 disease covers the first 180 days after infection, and stages 1 to 3 are based primarily on the CD4 cell counts to monitor disease progression. The lymphoid areas of the mucosal surfaces are the primary sites of initial infection, particularly if the mucosa has been damaged. Dendritic cells and mucosal T cells probably spread the infection to other peripheral lymphoid organs (especially follicular dendritic cells in the lymph nodes). Production of new virus particles proceeds rapidly with increasing viremia. HIV RNA may be detected in the plasma by 10 days after an acute infection and HIV p24 antigen detected about 4 to 10 days after viral RNA (Fig. 10.11). Indication of an individual's immune response quickly follows. HIV-specific IgM antibody is detected about 3 to 5 days after p24 antigen and levels of IgG begin rising soon afterwards and remain elevated throughout the disease process. As with most immune responses against viral diseases, the IgM levels are usually transient. The appearance of viral RNA in the plasma is indicative of viremia and the appearance of infectious virus in the body fluids, an indication that infected individuals can transmit HIV to other individuals. FIGURE 10.11 Typical Course of Progression from HIV Infection to AIDS in Untreated Persons. A, Within weeks after infection, the person may experience symptoms of acute HIV syndrome. During this early period the virus progressively infects mucosal T cells and dendritic cells, propagates, and spreads to the lymphoid organs, with a sharp decrease in the number of circulating CD4+ Th cells. The resulting immune response usually induces a period of clinical latency, during which viral replication and T-cell destruction continue in the lymph nodes, although the individual is generally asymptomatic. As the disease progresses, the person may develop HIV-related disease (constitutional symptoms)—a variety of symptoms of acute viral infection that do not involve opportunistic infections or malignancies. When the number of CD4+ cells is critically suppressed, the person becomes susceptible to a variety of opportunistic infections and cancers. The length of time for progression from HIV infection to AIDS may vary considerably from person to person. B, Antibody and Tc cell (cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]) levels change during the progression to AIDS. During the initial phase, antibodies against HIV-1 are not yet detectable (window period), but viral products, including p24 antigen, viral RNA, and infectious virus, may be detectable in the blood a few weeks after infection. Most antibodies produced against envelope proteins in the early phase are absorbed onto viral particles in the blood and are not detectable by most routine assays. During the latent phase of infection, antibody levels against p24 and other viral proteins, as well as HIV-specific CTLs, generally increase and then remain constant until the development of AIDS. As the immune system becomes severely depressed and excess viral antigen is released into the blood, measurable antibody levels decrease. Disease progression usually ends in the death of the untreated individual. (A redrawn from Fauci AS, Lane HC: Human immunodeficiency virus disease: AIDS and related conditions. In Fauci AS et al, editors: Harrison's principles of internal medicine, ed 14, New York, 1997, McGraw-Hill; B from Kumar V, Abbas A, Fausto N: Robbins & Cotran pathologic basis of disease, ed 8, Philadelphia, 2010, Saunders.) From 40% to 90% of individuals in stage 0 will experience symptoms of acute viral syndrome. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, headache, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), and a skin rash that can be extensive. Without knowledge of exposure to HIV, the infected individual may suspect a self-limiting influenza or infectious mononucleosis condition. By 180 days, the initial burst of viremia and acute viral syndrome will have resolved. The infected individual will be asymptomatic, yet infectious HIV is present in body fluids and the process of HIV-mediated destruction of CD4 cells has just begun. Stages 1 through 3 are determined by diminishing CD4 T-cell counts, adjusted for normal age-related levels. In the first year of life, the normal CD4 T-cell count is the highest and decreases with age. For instance, stage 1 disease is classified after 180 days of infection and the CD4 T-cell counts are still normal: ≥1500 cells/µL at <1 year, ≥1000 cells/µL at 1 through 5 years, and ≥500 cells/µL at 6 years to adult. Stage 2 is characterized by diminished numbers of CD4 T cells: 750 to 1499 cells/µL at <1 year, 500 to 999 cells/µL at 1 through 5 years, and 200 to 499 cells/µL at 6 years to adult. Stage 3 is defined as AIDS, determined by CD4 T-cell counts of <750, <500, or <200 cells/µL for the respective age groups, or the development of AIDS-related opportunistic infections, regardless of the CD4 T-cell count (Box 10.6).

Adapted from Selik RM et al: 2014, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 63(RR-03):1–10, 2014. Treatment and Prevention of HIV The current regimen of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for treatment of HIV infection is a combination of drugs that attack different portions of the viral replication pathway.29 Since the FDA approval of zidovudine (AZT), more than 25 antiretroviral agents representing 6 different classes have been approved to treat HIV/AIDS and several others are in various stages of testing. Classes of antiretroviral agents include inhibitors of the enzyme reverse transcriptase (nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]), inhibitors of the viral protease (protease inhibitors [PIs]), entry and intercellular fusion inhibitors that prevent attachment of the virus to the target cell or prevent fusion between HIV and the cell membrane, and inhibitors of the viral integrase enzyme (integrase strand transfer inhibitors [INSTIs]).29 A sixth group of drugs are pharmacokinetic enhancers, such as cobicistat (COBI), that are administered with some PIs and INSTIs. Enhancers affect intestinal transport proteins and liver enzyme that would normally break down some antiretroviral drugs, thus allowing smaller doses to be used. Many other drugs are in clinical testing, including Gag maturation inhibitors (prevent enzymatic activation of Gag precursor protein), gp120 inhibitors (prevent conformational changes necessary for attachment and entry process), and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bind to proteins on viral envelope and prevent attachment). The recommended first-line treatment is a combination of two NRTIs and a third drug from another class (see Fig. 10.10). Many drug combinations are available in a single pill, facilitating compliance. The specific regimen and drugs may vary based on a variety of an individual's characteristics. Other drugs (e.g., entry inhibitors) are reserved for those who develop resistance to first-line drugs. The goals of therapy are reduction of viral load in fluids, reduced HIV-associated morbidity, prolonged survival, and prevention of HIV transmission. The plasma viral load is frequently suppressed below detectable levels within weeks. With treatment beginning at the time of diagnosis, transmission has decreased by about 90%. Retroviral preventive treatment of uninfected partners of those who are HIV infected has diminished transmission by 96%. Without treatment, the progression from acute infection to AIDS takes 9 to 10 years, with death occurring within 2 to 3 years. Death from AIDS-related diseases has been reduced significantly since the introduction of HAART; those who respond well to HAART may survive for several decades. Continued suppression of HIV/AIDS progression absolutely requires daily and continuous use of medications. However, many people do not respond to HAART therapy; those who do respond are not “cured,” and resistant variants to these drugs have been identified. Individuals who initiate antiretroviral therapy will still have a shortened life expectancy secondary to HIV-associated persistent immune activation. Continued systemic inflammation secondary to persistent HIV infection and toxicity of available drugs increase the risk for developing chronic and potentially fatal morbidities. Complications include dyslipidemia (imbalance of blood lipids), insulin resistance, lipodystrophy (changes in body composition, either loss or accumulation of fat), decreased bone density and increase in incidence of fractures, diabetes, renal disease, and liver disease. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased twofold.30 Antiretroviral drug therapy does not cure HIV/AIDS because the HIV genome incorporates into the DNA of the infected cells that may act as reservoirs and release viral particles if therapy is stopped. The primary reservoir is probably long-lived CD4+ memory T cells, although contribution to the reservoir may include other infected cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, astrocytes, microglia, and hematopoietic progenitors.31 HIV also may persist in regions where the antiviral drugs are not as effective, such as the central nervous system (CNS). HIV penetrates the CNS early in the infection and persists despite successful treatment with antiretroviral drugs. Neural infection leads to viral encephalitis and apoptosis of neurons. The incidence of HIV-associated dementia was about 20% in untreated individuals, but antiretroviral therapy has reduced that number to about 5% and decreased the severity. Dementia is now rarely seen. Ultimately, the best hope for preventing the spread of HIV infection is development of an effective vaccine. Most common antiviral vaccines (e.g., rubella, mumps, influenza) induce protective antibodies that block the initial infection. Only one vaccine (rabies) is used after the infection has occurred. That approach is successful because the rabies virus proliferates and spreads very slowly. Whether an HIV vaccine would be effective in either preventing or treating HIV infection is problematic, and the results of recent vaccine trials have for the moment dampened enthusiasm. Characteristics of HIV have been difficult to overcome. HIV-1 commonly undergoes random mutations that result in an extreme and changing antigenic diversity.32 During transmission, bodily fluids may contain a variety of viral antigenic types so that effective vaccines may need to induce protection against a broad spectrum of HIV surface antigens. Pediatric HIV Neonates become HIV infected from their mothers by the passage of the virus across the placenta during pregnancy, by contact with infected maternal blood at childbirth, or through the milk during breast-feeding. The transmission rate in the United States was about 13%, but has been reduced to 1% with the use of prenatal antiviral therapy beginning early in pregnancy, the implementation of neonatal prophylaxis, and the avoidance of breast-feeding. Without prenatal treatment, symptoms of HIV infection usually develop within 6 months of neonatal life, 20% get opportunistic infections within the first year, and life expectancy is generally less than 3 years. Because of aggressive clinical intervention, there are currently fewer than 50 cases of pediatric HIV infection diagnosed yearly in the United States. The presence of passive maternal antibody limits the use of HIV antibody testing in infants in the high-risk category up to 18 months of age. The current recommended diagnostic procedure is testing initially for HIV nucleic acid: viral RNA in plasma, or DNA within cells. Determination of whether the child is infected is based on repeated negative test results.27 Two negative nucleic acid test results at 2 and 4 weeks after birth is considered a “presumptive” uninfected state. A “definitive” uninfected is defined as two nucleic acid test results at 1 and 4 months. Combined HAART is initiated immediately in infants and leads to reduced viral latency, a 76% reduction in AIDSrelated mortality, and many children reaching the adolescent period with functional immune systems. Complications in children undergoing HAART are related to metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.27 Because of the metabolic complications of HAART and the ongoing HIV-associated inflammation, half of HIV-infected children are at increased risk of coronary disease. Most HIV-infected children who reach adulthood will have indications of coronary artery abnormalities. A third or less of children will present with low bone density, but with no increase in fractures. A particularly vulnerable site of HIV infection in infants and children is the CNS. HIV encephalopathy is more common in the advanced stages. Because survival of children with HIV has been prolonged with effective treatment, the incidence of progressive encephalopathy has increased. For diagnosis of HIV-related neurologic effects, at least one of the following progressive findings needs to be present for at least 2 months, in the absence of a concurrent illness other than HIV that could explain the following findings: • Failure to attain or loss of developmental milestones, or loss of intellectual ability, verified by standard developmental scale or neuropsychologic tests • Impaired brain growth or acquired microcephaly demonstrated by head circumference measurements or brain atrophy demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with serial imaging required in children less than 2 years of age • Acquired symmetrical motor deficits manifested by affecting a child 1 month of age or older The onset of progressive encephalopathy may be a prognostic indicator of a poor outcome. Other insults may accompany HIV in a young child and affect growth and development, such as drug exposure, prematurity, chronic illness, and a chaotic social atmosphere. The pathogenesis of HIV encephalopathy in children is poorly understood, but the presence of inflammatory mediators may be a contributing factor. Countermeasures Against Pathogens An extremely effective means of countering infectious microorganisms is rigorous use of environmental infection control measures, including control of insect vector populations, establishment of modern sanitation facilities, provision of clean water and uncontaminated food supplies, and other measures. Additionally, prophylactic or therapeutic procedures have been developed to prevent pathogens from initiating disease (vaccines) or to subdue the pathogen once the disease process has started (antimicrobials). Vaccine development has focused successfully on preventing the most severe and common infections (Table 10.7). With the initial success of antibiotic therapy there was no perceived need for vaccination against many common and non–life-threatening infections. The increasing problem of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, however, forced a reappraisal of that strategy, and a greater emphasis is being placed on the development of new vaccines.

Updated May 11, 2010. http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/vaccines/understanding/pages/vaccinebenefits.aspx Infection Control Measures Although effective means of safeguarding populations from exposure to infectious disease are well known, lack of implementation or breakdowns in application of these initiatives have led to the reemergence of some infectious diseases. These diseases include cholera, dengue fever and West Nile virus. Sewage removal and other public health initiatives are now the expected norm in developed countries. The quality of water and food, as well as disposal of human and animal waste, remains poor in many developing countries. Rapid urbanization as well as other problems (e.g., poverty, overcrowding, mass relocation of people because of war, rapid destruction of forests) has put pressure on already inadequate systems. A 1991 outbreak of cholera in Peru resulted in an estimated 1100 deaths in Peru and more than 4000 deaths in Latin America, and was attributed to problems with infrastructure, including inadequate sanitation. Additionally, previously successful programs designed to control the breeding of insect vectors have been reversed. Despite an international emphasis on draining standing water that provides breeding grounds for mosquitoes, large unmanaged areas still abound. A very successful international mosquito eradication program resulted in decreasing incidence of mosquito-borne diseases. Some regions were declared “free” of mosquito-borne diseases. However, lack of access to pesticides, and failure or delay in initiating fumigation and larvacide programs for mosquitoes has resulted in rebound of mosquito-related diseases in previously disease-free regions in some parts of the world. The consequence is increasingly severe outbreaks of viral disease. An example is outbreaks of dengue virus and West Nile virus in areas of India in the last several years. This problem is exacerbated by the development of insecticideresistant mosquitoes. Antimicrobials Antibiotics are natural products of fungi, bacteria, and related microorganisms and kill or inhibit the growth of other microorganisms. They are basically microbial defense mechanisms by which one microorganism can defend itself against another. The goal of antibiotic therapy is elimination of the pathogenic microorganism. Some antibacterial antibiotics are bactericidal (kill the organism), whereas others are bacteriostatic (inhibit growth until the organism is destroyed by the individual's own protective mechanisms). The mechanisms of action of most antibiotics are (1) inhibition of the function or production of the cell wall, (2) prevention of protein synthesis, (3) blockage of DNA replication, or (4) interference with folic acid metabolism. Because viruses use the biochemical pathways of the host's cells, there has been far less success in developing specific antiviral antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance observed clinically is of major importance and has become a problem worldwide. As the use of penicillin became widespread, Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, frequently warned about the development of penicillin resistance, and the first bacterial penicillinase (enzyme that destroyed penicillin; βlactamase) was described in 1940 by Fleming's collaborators. At least 1000 variations of β-lactamase have since been discovered. Being natural products of microorganisms that exist in nature, resistance mechanisms also developed in nature. Genes related to antibiotic resistance have been characterized from samples of permafrost that were dated at 30,000 years ago from the oral microbiome of 2000-yearold skeletons, from the gut microbiome of a Peruvian mummy dated near 1000 AD, and from several other samples that greatly predate the era of therapeutic antibiotics.33 As might be expected, environment antibiotic resistance has increased greatly since the use of antibiotics in agriculture. The CDC publishes a list of antibiotic resistance threats ranked as urgent, serious, and concerning available at: https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html and https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/index.html.34 They estimated that more than 2 million antibiotic-resistant illnesses occur in the United States yearly, resulting in more than 23,000 deaths. The trend is progressing toward more infectious agents being resistant to multiple antibiotics, such as the classification of extensively drugresistant TB that is resistant to all of the first- and second-line drugs and the cases of some vancomycin-resistant infections that are resistant to almost all antibiotics (see What's New? Totally AntibioticResistant Infections Are Here!). What's New? Totally Antibiotic-Resistant Infections Are Here! The apparently unstoppable evolution by which bacteria add and horizontally transfer plasmids containing new antibiotic resistance genes has increased the fear of encountering microorganisms with total resistance to all available antibiotics (pan-antibiotic resistance). Two antibiotics have been used as drugs-of-last-resort to treat infections with gram-negative microorganisms. Carbapenem is a βlactam antibiotic similar to penicillin but with greater resistance to standard β-lactamases. Colistins (polymyxin E) are polypeptide antibiotics used to treat many gram-negative infections. Resistance genes have been recently described. In 2008, the enzyme New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-1 gene (blaNDM-1) conferred resistance to multiple carbapenems and in 2015 the colistin resistance 1 gene (mcr-1) was reported in China. Both resistance genes have spread globally. The presence of either NDM-1 or mcr-1 resistance gene on a plasmid with other resistance genes may confer a state of pan- antibiotic resistance. Several reports of this scenario have been published recently. In Germany, 2 individuals infected with Serratia marcescens with the NDM-1 gene in addition to other resistance genes were resistant to 32 different antibiotics representing 8 different groups of antimicrobials.1 In India, an individual with an aggressive eye infection (keratitis) with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to multiple antibiotics representing eight groups of antimicrobials.2 The danger of increased incidences of panantibiotic resistance has increased even further when a German group discovered bacteria with mcr-1 and NDM-1 genes on the same plasmid.3 Pan-antibiotic resistant infections have now been identified in the United States. The first report of an infection with a microorganism expressing mcr-1 came from Pennsylvania. The individual presented with a urinary tract infection with E. coli that expressed mcr-1.4 A similar case from New Jersey involved an elderly man with a urinary tract infection with E. coli that contained both mcr-1 and an NDM gene. The infection was resistant to both colistin and carbapenems.5 In both reports, the infection remained treatable only because the bacterial plasmid did not carry the entire repertoire of available resistance genes. The most recent report, however, confirms the presence of panantibiotic resistant microorganisms in the United States. An elderly female presented in Nevada with a wound infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to all 26 available antibiotics and died of septic shock 2 months after being admitted to the hospital.6 She had a history of multiple hospital admissions in India (where bacteria expressing the NDM-1 resistance gene are prevalent) related to a broken femur and osteomyelitis. Although a major effort is being taken to prevent pan-antibiotic resistant infections from entering the United States and spreading from individual to individual, encountering these microorganisms more often should be expected. These highly dangerous infections will not be limited to bacteria. A case of pan-antibiotic resistant, opportunistic yeast, Trichosporon dermatis, was recently reported in the Netherlands.7 The persistent infection was resistant to all conventional therapy and the individual died from multiorgan failure.

Antibiotic resistance may result from a variety of inherited processes that can coexist in different combinations in the same microorganism. Resistance genes can be spread within the bacterial community by horizontal gene transfer. Genetic information can be transferred by means of transformation (uptake of short DNA fragments from the environment), by transduction (transfer of DNA by means of viruses that infect bacteria, bacteriophages), or by conjugation (transfer of DNA, usually in the form of circular plasmids, through pili connecting the bacteria). A single plasmid may contain a large amount of genetic information for multiple types of antibiotic resistance. Enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics is one of the most common forms of resistance. The β-lactam antibiotics contain a β-lactam ring central to their structures and are bactericidal by inhibiting formation of the bacterial cell wall. The initial class of β-lactam antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, cephalosporins) blocked synthesis of the gram-positive cell wall, whereas newer broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics (e.g., carboxypenicillins) also affect gram-negative cell wall synthesis. Resistance is conferred by enzymatic (β-lactamase) destruction of the antibiotic. Another class of antibiotics, aminoglycosides (e.g., streptomycin, neomycin, gentamicin), is bactericidal primarily to gram-negative aerobic bacteria and against tuberculosis by binding to sites on ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and inhibiting protein synthesis. Resistance is conferred by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs), which acetylate and inactivate aminoglycoside. Another major form of antibiotic resistance is caused by multi– drug-resistance transporters (MDRs). MDRs are members of a diverse and widely expressed family of transmembrane proteins that are designed to protect the cell by diminishing the rate of intracellular accumulation of antimicrobials by preventing entrance or, more commonly, increasing active efflux of the antibiotic. At least six different bacterial MDR families have been identified, with their genes also primarily carried on plasmids that can be transferred to other bacteria.35 Expression of MDRs is not limited to bacteria; C. albicans uses multiple MDRs as efflux pumps for antibiotics. Individual MDRs are capable of transporting and simultaneously protecting microorganisms from several antibiotics (e.g., kanamycin, erythromycin, doxycycline). Other methods of antibiotic resistance are less common, but still important in understanding the combination of protective mechanisms leading to multidrug resistance.36 Antibiotics gain entrance to bacteria by passing through the cell wall. Resistance may result from sequestration or decreased uptake of the antibiotic. Thickened cell walls or biofilms trap antibiotics in the extracellular matrix to prevent access to bacteria. Decreased uptake also may result from modification of the cell wall; P. aeruginosa undergoes minor changes in cell wall chemistry and becomes resistant to the uptake of β-lactam antibiotics. Additional mechanisms protect the molecular target of particular antibiotics. The target may be altered by mutation or other means. Genetic amplification and overproduction of the target molecule result in excessive numbers of targets and reduced antibiotic sensitivity (e.g., increased resistance to sulfonamides in some streptococci). Target bypass is a resistance mechanism resulting from switch from an antibiotic-sensitive metabolic to one that is more antibiotic resistant. Some bacteria have gained resistance to sulfonamide by converting from use of environmental paraaminobenzoic acid for conversion to folic acid, which is an antibioticsensitive step in nucleic acid synthesis, to the direct use of environmental folic acid. The target molecule also can be protected by novel bacterial proteins that block the antibiotic binding site. Multi– antibiotic resistance results from the simultaneous application of a combination of mechanisms. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) caused an international healthcare crisis. Outside of the United States, MRSA accounts for 80% of S. aureus infections. MRSA produces a β-lactamase. Normally β-lactamase–resistant broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., methicillin) can be substituted. However, MRSA also carries an extra-chromosomal gene mecA for resistance to methicillin. The mecA gene encodes a penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) with a lower affinity for β-lactams and, therefore, less sensitivity to inhibition by antibiotics. Resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics is accomplished by expression of AMEs, production of excess para-aminobenzoic acid, and spontaneous mutation of rRNA with a lower affinity for antibiotics. Resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin is controlled by the gene vanA, which results in alterations in peptidoglycans and loss of the vancomycin-binding site. Antibiotic sequestration also occurs in the thick peptidoglycan layer and within biofilms. MRSA expresses four different classes of multi– drug-resistance transporters.37 Fusidic acid, one of few drugs for MRSA, binds to the ribosome and prevents protein synthesis. Resistance results from small proteins that bind to the target and prevent interactions with the antibiotic.38 Multiple antibiotic resistance has appeared and can be related to overuse of antibiotics and not completing an antibiotic regimen. Overuse of antibiotics leads to the destruction of the normal microbiome, allowing the selective overgrowth of antibiotic-resistant strains or pathogens that had previously been kept under control. For example, treatment with clindamycin can compromise the normal intestinal microbiome allowing the overgrowth of C. difficile and the development of pseudomembranous colitis. Lack of compliance in completing a therapeutic antibiotic regimen allows the selective resurgence of microorganisms that are more relatively resistant to the antibiotic. With the development of multiple antibiotic–resistant strains, creativity in addressing this challenge must be rekindled. New antibiotics may solve a portion of the problem or may exacerbate it further as pathogens develop resistance to new antibiotics as well. Available antibiotics that prove to be no longer effective must be replaced with alternative forms of therapy, including the increased development and use of vaccines. In that context, an old treatment has been revisited: the administration of lytic bacteriophages. Bacteriophages are viruses that specifically infect bacteria and, in the case of lytic phages, result in bacterial death and lysis. The advantages of bacteriophage therapy are numerous: cocktails of complementary phages can be used, phages can progressively infiltrate a biofilm that traps antibiotics, and phages can be genetically engineered to express enzymes that weaken the biofilm. Bacterial resistance to phages may occur related to alteration of phage receptors on the bacteria. However, this therapeutic agent clearly needs to be explored further and studies are in progress to test the effect of bacteriophage therapy on P. aeruginosa chronic lung infections.39 Active Immunization: Vaccines Contracting and surviving an infectious disease is the most effective means of developing lifelong immunity against a particular pathogen. However, some infections cause a great deal of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of vaccination is to induce active immunologic protection before exposure to the risks of debilitating or fatal infection. For each vaccine an initial immunization protocol is developed to produce large numbers of memory cells and a sustained protective secondary immune response in the greatest number of individuals. Even under optimized protocols, vaccines are not completely protective. For every vaccine a small percentage of recipients do not produce a protective immune response, referred to as primary vaccine failure. Failure to induce an immune response occurs in about 10% of recipients of measles (rubeola), mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B vaccines, and inactivated influenza vaccine may only protect 30% to 40% of adults 65 or older.40 A recently approved, high-dose injectable vaccine with four times the amount of influenza antigen is now recommended for increased protection of adults 65 or older. In general, vaccine-induced protection does not persist as long as infection-induced immunity; thus booster injections may be necessary to maintain protection throughout life. Secondary vaccine failure results if appropriate booster immunizations are not administered. Many adults vaccinated against diseases that are more severe in childhood will not get routine boosters. Although not developing debilitating illness, they may become asymptomatic carriers and infect unvaccinated children. The CDC maintains the most current immunization schedules for people of all ages. Mass vaccination programs have led to major changes in the health of the world's population.41 For example global eradication of smallpox by 1979. In 1994 polio was declared officially eradicated in all the Americas. The goal of the WHO is to eradicate polio worldwide by 2022. Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome were declared eliminated in the Americas in 2015, and in 2016 measles was eradicated. Although eliminated in the Americas, measles and rubella have not been eliminated elsewhere and infected visitors from other countries may transmit the infection to individuals who have not been vaccinated. A certain percentage of the population (usually about 85%, with a range of 75% to 99% depending on the particular microorganism) should be immunized in order to achieve protection of the total population, referred to as herd immunity. The principles of calculating herd immunity are based on several parameters: the number of susceptible individuals who may become infected in an unvaccinated population from an initial case, the time interval over which the infection may spread, and the effectiveness of the vaccine. An individual infected with measles can infect 12 to 18 other individuals over about 2 weeks. If the desired level of herd immunity is not achieved, outbreaks of infection can occur. The WHO declared that measles was eradicated in the United States in 2000, and many parents became either complacent or resistant to immunization. This resulted in at least 23 outbreaks of measles in 2014 triggered by exposure to infected visitors to the United States or travel by U.S. citizens to areas where measles was still endemic. Most of the infected individuals had no history of immunization and the required level of herd immunity had not been maintained.42 The incidence of pertussis (whooping cough) in the United States has also reflected resistance to vaccination. In 2004, 32 pertussis outbreaks were published; analysis of 8 of these found that 59% to 93% of infected individuals were intentionally not vaccinated. Immunization programs in several European countries have been disrupted by anti–vaccine groups. As a result, the incidence of pertussis increased by 10 to 100 times compared with neighboring countries that maintained a high incidence of immunization. Resistance to routine vaccination has arisen for many reasons, particularly potential vaccine dangers. As with any medicine, complications can arise, including pain and redness at the injection site, fever, allergic reactions to vaccine ingredients, infection associated with attenuated viruses in immunodeficient individuals, and others. Additionally, some individuals in the United States and Europe became concerned that vaccines, particularly those containing the preservative thimerosal, induced autism in children. Thimerosal is a mercury-containing compound that has been used as a preservative since the 1930s. Multiple studies concluded that neither vaccines nor thimerosal was associated with the onset of autism.43,44 The debate related to thimerosal and many other environmental chemicals to autism is still under investigation.45,46 Although no cases of mercury toxicity have been reported secondary to vaccination, thimerosal was removed from all vaccines by 2001 with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccines. Development of a successful vaccine depends on many factors. These include characterizing the desired protective immune response (e.g., antibody, T cell), identifying the appropriate antigen to induce that response (i.e., immune responses against some antigens on an infectious agent are ineffective or even increase the risk for infection), determining the most effective route of administration (e.g., injected, oral, inhaled), optimizing the number and timing of vaccine doses to induce protective immunity in a large proportion of the at-risk population, and deciding the most effective, yet safe, form in which to administer the vaccine. For instance, most vaccines against viral infections (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, Varicella zoster [chickenpox], yellow fever) contain live viruses that are weakened (attenuated) to continue expressing the appropriate antigens but are unable to establish more than a limited and easily controlled infection. The limited proliferative capacity of attenuated live viruses appears to afford better long-term protection than using purified viral antigen. Exceptions are the vaccines against hepatitis B, which uses a recombinant viral protein, and hepatitis A, which is an inactivated (killed) virus. Even attenuated viruses can, however, establish life-threatening infections in vaccine recipients whose immune system is congenitally deficient or suppressed (see Chapter 9). Two different vaccines were developed against polio. The Sabin vaccine is an attenuated virus that is administered orally (oral polio vaccine [OPV]). It provides systemic protection and induces a secretory immune response to prevent growth of the poliovirus in the intestinal tract. The live attenuated vaccine causes polio in some children who have unsuspected immune deficiencies (about 1 case in 2.4 million doses). The Salk vaccine is a completely inactivated virus administered by injection (inactivated polio vaccine [IPV]). It induces protective systemic immunity but does not provide adequate secretory immunity. Therefore even if the individual is protected from systemic infection the “wild-type” poliovirus can transiently infect the intestinal mucosa, be shed, and spread to others. For example, when polio was epidemic, the live oral vaccine was preferred; however, about eight cases of paralytic polio per year in the United States result from the vaccine strain proliferating in individuals with inadequate immune systems. As a result, the CDC currently recommends vaccination with the killed virus. Some common bacterial vaccines are killed microorganisms or extracts of bacterial antigens. S. pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a major cause of pneumonia, particularly in the young and adults with compromised lung function secondary to smoking, asthma, and other lung diseases. Of the more than 90 known strains of this microorganism, only a few cause the most severe illnesses. The current vaccines against pneumococcal pneumonia consist of a mixture of capsular polysaccharides. The conjugated vaccine is recommended for young children in whom the pure polysaccharide vaccine is not very immunogenic. A similar vaccine is available for H. influenzae type B (Hib), which is a cause of pneumonia and meningitis in children. Some bacterial diseases are caused by potent bacterial toxins that act locally or systemically. These include diphtheria, cholera, and tetanus. Vaccination against the toxins is achieved using toxoids—purified toxins that have been chemically detoxified without loss of immunogenicity. Pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine was changed from a killed whole cell vaccine to an acellular vaccine that contained the pertussis toxin and additional bacterial antigens. With so many available vaccines there has been an effort to mix vaccines in order to minimize the number of required injections. An example is DPT, now usually contains diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (aP). More recent mixtures include DTaP mixed with inactivated poliovirus, hepatitis B vaccine, or H. influenzae antigen or a mixture of these. Passive Immunotherapy Passive immunotherapy is a form of countermeasure against pathogens in which preformed antibodies are given to the individual. This form of therapy has been used for decades. Horse serum that contained antibodies was used to treat diphtheria, pneumococcal pneumonia, tetanus, and other diseases in the early twentieth century. However, because of foreign proteins in the serum, many individuals developed an immune reaction against the horse proteins and an immune complex–mediated serum sickness. Passive immunotherapy with human immunoglobulin has been approved for several infections, including hepatitis B and hepatitis A. Treatment of potential rabies infection after a bite combines passive and active immunization. The rabies virus proliferates very slowly. Individuals who have been bitten receive a one-time injection with human rabies immune globulin to further slow viral proliferation, followed by multiple injections with a killed viral vaccine to induce greater protective immunity. A recent example of passive immunotherapy is the 2014 to 2016 outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa, the largest outbreak of Ebola infection ever observed: 28,616 cases with 11,310 fatalities (a 40% mortality rate). No vaccine was available. An experimental mixture of monoclonal antibodies against the virus rapidly increased circulating antibody titers and diminished viral load by more than eightfold.47 In the past, vaccines and therapeutic antibodies were developed for only the deadliest pathogens. With the increase in antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, the development and widespread use of new vaccines and passively administered antibodies against these microorganisms must be considered. Summary Review Emerging Infections 1. Emergence of previously unknown infections, reemergence of old infections thought to be controlled, and the development of infections resistant to multiple antibiotics or vaccination are significant causes of death and morbidity. Microorganisms and Humans: A Dynamic Relationship 1. The human body is a hospitable site for microorganisms to grow and flourish. These microorganisms make up the normal microbiome of the body. 2. The beneficial homeostasis between humans and microorganisms is maintained through the physical integrity of the gut and other mechanisms that sequester these microorganisms on the mucosal surface. 3. The symbiotic relationship with the normal microbiome can be altered by injury, compromising protective barriers including the skin and mucous membranes. Microorganisms and Infections 1. Clinical infectious disease occurs in four distinct stages: (1) incubation period, (2) prodromal state, (3) invasion period, and (4) convalescence. 2. The hallmark of most infectious diseases is fever. Body temperature is regulated at a higher than normal level. 3. Several factors influence the capacity of a pathogen to cause disease, including communicability, immunogenicity, infectivity, mechanisms of action, pathogenicity, entry portal, toxigenicity, and virulence. 4. Infectious diseases also are classified by their prevalence and spread as endemic, epidemic, and pandemic. 5. The process of infection includes colonization, invasion, multiplication, and dissemination. 6. When an individual's immune system is deficient, the person can become infected with opportunistic infections. 7. True pathogens in adequate numbers can circumvent an individual's defenses and directly cause infection. 8. Infectious microorganisms usually exist in reservoirs (e.g., contaminated soil, contaminated water or food, breast milk), animals, or another human. 9. Direct transmission of pathogens can occur by direct physical contact, ingestion or inhalation, or placental transfer. 10. Indirect transmission occurs from contact with contaminated materials, which can range from towels to food or through a vector. 11. As part of colonization, the microorganism stabilizes the adherence to tissue through surface receptors and can then invade surrounding tissue. 12. Because tissue is warm and nutrient rich, most microorganisms undergo rapid multiplication. Viral pathogens replicate within infected cells, and some bacteria are intracellular pathogens and replicate in macrophages and other cells. 13. Successful spreading requires a variety of virulence factors, including adhesion molecules, toxins, and the ability to evade immunity. 14. Mixed species of microorganisms can come together and form slimy biofilms and anchor themselves to various surfaces and resist immune defenses. 15. Stable colonization of bacteria requires adhesion. Many bacteria attach through pili (fimbriae), surface glycoproteins, or complement-related receptors. 16. Invasion results in direct confrontation with an individual's defense mechanisms, including complement, antibodies, and phagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages). Evasion of these defenses can result in bacteremia or viremia or fungemia and sepsis. 17. Bacteria can protect against phagocytosis by producing toxins that destroy phagocytic cells and extracellular enzymes that digest complement, clotting factors, immunoglobulins, cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides and promote extracellular spreading. 18. Classes of infectious microorganisms include bacterial, fungal, parasitic, protozoal, and viral. 19. Bacteria are divided into several groups—“true bacteria,” filamentous, spirochetes, mycoplasma, rickettsia, and chlamydia—and can be categorized as gram negative or gram positive. 20. Many bacteria have specialized surface structures such as pili and flagella that promote adhesion and tissue invasion. 21. Bacteria can produce a variety of toxic molecules that may kill the individual's cells, disrupt tissue, and protect the individual against inflammation. 22. Exotoxins are released by bacteria during bacterial growth and can damage cell membranes, activate second messengers, and inhibit protein synthesis. 23. Endotoxins are contained in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria and released during lysis of the bacteria. Bacteria that produce endotoxins are called pyrogenic bacteria because they activate inflammation and produce fever. They also can activate the coagulation cascade and release cachectin (TNF). 24. Inflammatory and immune responses to infection can cause tissue damage through excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, excessive activation of antibodies, and infiltration of T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. 25. Other self-protective mechanisms for bacteria and other pathogens include degradation of immune molecules, neutralization of immune molecules, complement evasion, immune suppression, and escape from the phagosome. 26. Some bacteria (and viruses) proliferate more rapidly than the development of immune defenses causing severe clinical disease. 27. Some bacteria (like viruses) evade immune defenses by surviving inside immune cells. 28. Some bacteria can coat the Fc portion of an individual's antibody, preventing complement activation or phagocytosis. 29. Antigenic variation allows pathogens to alter surface molecules that express antigens that are the targets of protective immune responses. The pathogen thus becomes resistant. 30. Some bacteria can release molecules that bind to and neutralize antibody or form immune complexes that deposit in tissue, causing damage. 31. Some bacteria can degrade immunoglobulins or components of the complement system. 32. Some bacteria can suppress immune responses that block T cells or impair the signals in the inflammatory response or interfere with antigen processing and presentation. 33. S. aureus has numerous virulence factors that promote invasive infection. It has become a major cause of hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections and antibiotic resistance. 34. Fungal infection is called mycosis. Most pathologic fungi are from the environment and transmitted by human-to-human contact, inhalation, or contamination of wounds. 35. Fungi have polysaccharide surface molecules that promote adhesion to epithelial tissue. 36. Fungi can produce toxins that promote infection, evade immune responses, or cause cancer (aflatoxins). 37. Some fungi secrete enzymes that damage tissue and initiate pathogenic inflammatory responses including hypersensitivity reactions. 38. Some fungi can survive in phagocytes and resist lysosomal destruction. 39. C. albicans is the most common cause of fungal infections in humans. It resides in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, mouth, and vagina. Local defense mechanisms, including members of the bacterial microbiome, produce antifungal agents. The infection remains localized in individuals with an intact immune system. 40. Parasitic organisms establish a symbiosis with another species, whereby the parasite benefits. They range from unicellular protozoa to large worms. 41. Parasites adhere to and break down connective tissue and basement membranes allowing penetration and entry to the circulatory system. 42. Some parasites only reproduce within host cells (obligatory intracellular parasites). 43. Some parasites evade immune defenses by secreting cytotoxic molecules or by antigenic variation. 44. Malaria is one of the most common infections worldwide. It is transmitted through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. The parasite (Plasmodium) enters the bloodstream, survives in the liver, and invades parenchymal cells. After several rounds of division, the liver cell ruptures and thousands of parasites enter the blood, infecting red blood cells. 45. Viruses are intracellular microorganisms. The viral life cycle is completely intracellular and involves several stages: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release of new virions. 46. Viruses are classified by the format of nucleic acid in the virion, (RNA or DNA and either single-stranded [ss] or double-stranded [ds]), and by whether the virus uses the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) for replication. 47. Successful viruses use a variety of mechanisms for bypassing immune rejection, including rapid division, intracellular survival, coating with self-proteins, antigenic variation, neutralization, complement evasion, and immune suppression. 48. Viruses inside the infected cell have several harmful effects, including inhibition of DNA, RNA, or protein synthesis; disruption of lysosomal membranes, resulting in lytic enzyme release; promotion of cell apoptosis; fusion of adjacent cells (i.e., giant cells); transformation into a neoplastic cell; and alteration of antigenic properties (i.e., decreasing immune effectiveness). 49. An example of viral infection is influenza, an ssRNA virus transmitted through aerosol and body fluids, and there are several variant forms. Influenza viruses undergo antigen shifts allowing them to evade protection from vaccines. Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 1. AIDS is a viral disease caused by HIV. 2. HIV infects and depletes a portion of the immune system (Th cells), making individuals susceptible to life-threatening infections and malignancies. 3. HIV/AIDS remains a major cause of death worldwide. 4. Aggressive antiretroviral therapy and public health campaigns have stabilized the number of new cases and deaths in the United States from HIV/AIDS and other parts of the world where there is access to therapy. 5. HIV is a blood-borne pathogen present in body fluids with typical routes of transmission: blood or blood products, intravenous drug abuse, heterosexual and homosexual activity, and maternal-child transmission before or during birth. 6. The primary surface receptor on HIV is the envelope glycoprotein gp120, which binds to the CD4 molecule found mostly on the surface of T-helper cells. Several other important co-receptors have been identified. 7. HIV is a member of the retrovirus family, which carries genetic information in the form of RNA. An enzyme, reverse transcriptase (RT), converts RNA into a double-stranded DNA. Another enzyme, an integrase, inserts the new DNA into the infected cell's genetic material. On activation, translation of the viral information may be initiated, forming new virions, resulting in lysis and death of the infected cell, and shedding infectious HIV particles. 8. The major immunologic finding in AIDS is the striking decrease in the number of CD4+ Th cells. 9. The presence of circulating antibody against HIV indicates infection by the virus, although many individuals are asymptomatic. 10. The current treatment for HIV infection is a combination of drugs called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) that attacks different portions of the viral replication pathway. 11. Mother-to-child transmission has been reduced to 1% with prenatal treatment of HIV infection. 12. Neonates become HIV infected by placental transmission or through breast-feeding. 13. Children with HIV are at increased risk of coronary artery disease. Countermeasures Against Pathogens 1. Effective means of countering infectious microorganisms are rigorous use of environmental infection control measures, including control of insect vector populations, establishment of modern sanitation facilities, and provision of clean water and uncontaminated food supplies. Prophylactic or interventive procedures include vaccines and antimicrobials. 2. Passive immunotherapy has been effective using previously formed human immunoglobulin for diseases such as hepatitides A and B, rabies, and ebola. 3. With antibiotic-resistant pathogens, a greater emphasis is placed on the development of new vaccines.
